Introduction.


This monograph treats of the topography, geology, mineral wealth
and soils of Costa Rica; it describes its climate and presents the
details of its flora and fauna with reference to their economic
value; it displays the distribution of population according to
race, wealth, communities and social conditions; it examines the
agricultural development of the Republic, including its live stock
and forests; and, finally, it recounts the most important features of
its commerce, industry, finance, and of its economic and political
conditions.

It is made up of observations and studies pursued in 1897 and
1898, during seven and a half months of economic and scientific
explorations in Central America, and of facts garnered with great
care from authoritative manuscripts, books and official documents
and publications. Respect has been shown to the work of men of
originality in research and thought, and care has been taken
to adhere closely to the original text when either quoting or
translating. I am especially indebted to Professor H. Pittier, whose
great qualifications for a scientific exploration of Costa Rica
cannot be overestimated; to Mr. Anastasio Alfaro, the Director of
the National Museum; to Mr. Manuel Aragon, the Director General of
the National Statistical Department; to Dr. Juan Ullua, the Minister
of Fomento; to Joaquin B. Calvo, Minister Resident in Washington;
and Mr. Rafael Iglesias, the able President of the Republic of Costa
Rica.




The State of Costa Rica.




I.

TOPOGRAPHY, GEOLOGY AND MINERAL WEALTH.


Costa Rica, the southernmost Republic of Central America, is
advantageously situated within the North tropical zone, adjoining
Colombia, the most northern state of South America. It is between
the two great oceans, having also the prospect of one inter-oceanic
ship-canal at one extremity and another ship-canal near the other.

Costa Rica is between 8° and 11° 16′ N. latitude and 81° 35′ and
85° 40′ W. longitude from Greenwich. Its area is between 54,070 and
59,570 sq. kilometers, the difference arising from the boundary line
unsettled with Colombia. We follow here Colonel George Earl Church’s
paper in the London Geographical Journal of July, 1897, which gives
in a condensed form all important results of extensive explorations
by Professor H. Pittier as well as well-written abstracts of
important publications of the “Instituto fisico geografico Nacional”
and of the “Museo Nacional” of Costa Rica.

The mountains of Costa Rica are not a continuous Cordillera, although
in general they extend from the frontier of Colombia to within a few
miles of Brito. The entire country may properly be divided into two
distinctive groups by a natural line running between the mouths of
the Reventazon and Rio Grande de Pirris; groups which can be called
“volcanic mountains” or “mountains of the northwest,” and “Talamanca
mountains” or “mountains of the southeast.” It is clear that the
Caribbean Sea once joined the Pacific Ocean through this valley of
the river Reventazon in which the Costa Rica Railway now climbs to
reach Cartago. In weighing existing data there seems to be no room
for doubt that the highlands of Costa Rica once formed part of a
vast archipelago extending from Panama to Tehuantepec. The lowest
inter-oceanic depressions between the Arctic Ocean and the Straits
of Magellan are the divide between the two oceans at Panama which is
286 feet above the sea-level, and the narrow strip of land separating
Lake Nicaragua from the Pacific, which has only about 150 feet
elevation.

The “volcanic mountains” or “the mountains of the northwest” can
again be divided into two sections. The first comprises the part
situated between the Rio Reventazon and a depression which connects
San Ramon with the water-shed of San Carlos, including the groups
of the volcanoes Turialba (11,000 feet), Irazú (11,200 feet), Barba
(9335 feet) and Poas (8675 feet). The second section comprises the
part which extends from the Barranca River to the Lake of Nicaragua
with the groups of Tilaran, Miravalles, La Vieja and Orosi.

The first section may be called “Cordillera Central” or “Cordillera
del Irazú” and the second “Cordillera del Miravalles.” The three
masses which form the volcanic Cordillera of Irazú are separated by
two depressions: first by that of La Palma, 1500 meters above the
sea, between Irazú and Barba, and second by that of Desengaño, 1800
meters above the sea, between Barba and Poas.

The basis of the two western masses seems to be formed of basaltic
rocks, while the trachytes dominate in the eastern mass. Irazú and
Turialba, which is part of the same mass, seem to have ejected lavas
in a compact state. The height of volcanoes diminishes towards the
west.

The three orographic groups which dominate the northern central
plateau do not show the regular conical form which usually
characterizes a volcano. The general line of the southern
slopes ascends in an imperceptible manner towards the summit,
notwithstanding that they are composed of a succession of terrace
plains. On the Irazú, for instance, eight such terraces are
observable from Cartago to the summit. The northern declivity is more
precipitous, being over 60° on the Irazú.

The peak of the Irazú is a point from which go various spurs and
secondary mountains in opposite directions, one to the west and
one to the east, the latter terminating in a crater where the
Parismina River takes its origin. The western mountains trend first
in a westerly direction to the Cerro Pelon, where they divide, one
part descending south to the pass of Ochomogo, 1540 meters above
sea-level; the other, after taking a northwesterly direction,
terminating in the plain of La Palma, which is a part of the
water-shed of the two oceans. On the south various mountains follow
the rivers Pirris and Turialba. The Irazú has various craters, formed
successively, each one contributing to the gradual rising of the mass.

The Irazú, which had eruptions in 1723, 1726, 1821 and 1847, has now
an altitude of 3414 m. (11,200 feet), and from its summit both oceans
are visible, and also the great valleys of San Juan and of Lake
Nicaragua, as well as the mountains of Pico Blanco, Chirripo, Buena
Vista and Las Vueltas. Turialba had a famous eruption of sand and
ashes which began on the 17th of August, 1864, and lasted to March,
1865. Its heaviest ejected matter fell to the west, and Seebach
classifies it as andesite. Another eruption, occurring on February 6,
1866, was accompanied by heavy earthquakes and sent its ashes as far
as Puntarenas.

The Cordillera del Miravalles commences with the volcano Orosi,
situated near the southwest extremity of Lake Nicaragua. In its
southeast trend it recedes more and more from the lake and the San
Juan River. It is an irregular, broad and volcano-dotted chain,
about sixty geographical miles long, breaking down gradually on
the northwest from Orosi to the Sapoa River, one of the southern
boundaries of Nicaragua. In this short distance are found the Cerro
de la Vieja (6508 feet), the Montemuerto (8000 feet), the beautiful
volcano Tenorio (6700 feet), the volcanoes Miravalles (4665 feet),
the Rincon (4498 feet), and the Orosi (5195 feet).

These mountains, as far as they have been examined, are found to
be of eruptive origin, basalts and trachytes predominating, but
extensive sedimentary rock formations are also found upon their
slopes, as well as vast deposits of boulders, clay, earth and
volcanic material.

The peninsula of Nicoya, forming a part of Guanacaste, is partly
an elevated plain and partly consists of hills and mountain ridges
seldom attaining a greater elevation than 1500 feet. It is also
composed of eruptive rocks and sedimentary formations, the latter
being especially visible in the valley of Tempisque.

Between the northern volcanic section and the more regular Talamanca
range is the notable “Ochomogo” Pass, about twenty miles broad, and a
little more than 5000 feet above the sea-level at the water parting.

To the eastward through this gap, and in a broad, deeply eroded
valley, runs the tumultuous Reventazon River, and to the westward the
Rio Grande de Pirris. On the south of this depression the Chirripo
Grande mountain mass sends off east and west two immense flanking
ranges. A part of the western range, lying between San Marcos and
Santa Maria, for a length of about six miles, is known as the Dota
ridge, to which former explorers gave great importance.

This lofty, transverse and precipitous mountain system almost
forbids communication between the northern and southern halves of
the Republic, and, as Colonel Church says, must at all times have
had a marked influence on the movement of races in this part of
Central America. Both the northern and Talamanca sections present
mountains in masses instead of sierrated like many Andean chains of
North America. Those of the Talamanca section are Rovalo (7050 feet),
Pico Blanco (9650 feet). Chirripo Grande (11,850 feet) and Buena
Vista (10,820 feet). There are no signs of recent volcanic activity
in the Talamanca range. The Talamanca mountains have narrow crests
and are very precipitous on the Atlantic side, with evidences of
extensive denudations and erosions caused by the ceaseless rain-laden
trade-winds.

Professor William M. Gabb, in his geological sketch of Talamanca,
observes that the geological structure of the entire region is very
simple. The greatest expanse is occupied by recent sedimentary rocks
raised and nearly entirely metamorphosed by the action of volcanic
masses.

At several points along the Atlantic coast, there are found masses
of rocks of still later date. Professor Gabb maintains that the
nucleus of the great Cordillera of the interior is formed by granites
and syenites, which, like the sediment that covers them, are broken
through here and there by dikes of volcanic origin identical with
the eruptive material found on a greater scale in the northern part
of Costa Rica. The syenites are intrusive and have their culminating
point and greatest development in the Pico Blanco or Kamuk, a
mountain of great altitude, unusual ruggedness and scarred with deep
and precipitous cañons. All these dikes are of more modern formation
and are porphyritic. Professor Gabb also notes a thick deposit of
conglomerates and sandstones, schists and limestones, the schists
being the most abundant; although the conglomerates, found all over
the region, indicate the previous existence of an older sedimentary
formation.

The pebbles which form the conglomerates are composed of metamorphic
clay, having a character distinct from all the other rocks found
in the country. The cement is also clay or sand. The absence of
crystalline rocks in the conglomerates is irrefutable proof that,
when these were deposited, the syenites and granites had not yet
appeared from the interior of the earth. The limestone and sandstone
represent a less developed geographical horizon of the sedimentary
group, the latter appearing occasionally in layers, interstratified
with conglomerates or more recent schists. In no place in Talamanca
have fossils been found in these sandstones, although the same rocks
are very fossiliferous near Zapote on the River Reventazon.

In regard to fossils, Professor Gabb saw at Las Lomas Station, about
seven hundred feet above the sea, in the Bonilla Cliffs cutting,
shark’s teeth, compact masses of sea shells, fish, etc., and at an
elevation of 2500 feet large deposits of compact shell limestone.

The schists have a fine, leaf-like texture, and are easily decomposed
and reduced to a black mud, if they have not been metamorphosed. In
this rock fossils have been found which belong to a Miocene age.

Along the Talamanca coast calcareous deposits are found in horizontal
layers, and are probably elevated coral reefs, a rock which Professor
Gabb calls “antillite,” and which is developed in the entire
Caribbean region. It belongs to the post-Pliocene formation, the last
of the Tertiary series.

In the interior valleys a thick deposit of pebbles and clays of
recent origin is observed. The limit between the syenites of the
high mountains and the metamorphosed Miocene formation is found in
proximity to the Depuk River. In the slopes of the hills the schists
are usually decomposed and covered with red clay, a sub-soil above
which is found a small cap of fertile vegetable mold. In the valley
of Tsuku the schists are profoundly altered and transformed in a
magnesic or semi-talcous rock. The schists are more silicified in
coming near to the limits of the syenites.

Higher up, the granitic rocks extend in the direction of the Pico
Blanco without interruption. The Pico Blanco itself is of granite.
Three hundred feet below the summit porphyry is observed, while the
summit itself shows a greenish-brown trachyte with black spots.

In regard to the Pacific side of this Talamanca section, Professor
H. Pittier says, “The southern coast Cordillera, as a whole, is
formed of a nucleus of basaltic or syenitic rocks, above which
are found successively limestone in very deep banks and sometimes
fossiliferous: then argillaceous and marly schists; again, sandstone
and conglomerates, the latter forming generally the crests of the
hills and giving way very easily to atmospheric action, which
produces its decomposition and is the cause of sterile lands
characterized by savannas and the absence of forests on the upper
parts of the mountains, as well as in certain lower and denuded
parts. The conglomerates are made up of heterogeneous elements whose
resistance to erosion is variable. Some disintegrate as soon as they
are exposed to erosion, while others remain unaltered for a long
time. For this reason the savannas are in many places covered with
stones of varied sizes.”

The lower valley of the Pirris presents a cap of impervious red clay,
and, as the waters do not readily drain off they become stagnant and
make an unhealthy district.

Dr. Frantzius, referring to the same region, speaks of diorites and
syenites, also of calcareous deposits of the Miocene age covered with
sandstone formations containing useful lignites. In his opinion the
mountain of Dota is formed almost entirely of dioritic rocks with
some syenitic nucleus. The same scientist says further that the high
plains of Caños Gordas are formed of conglomerates of ashes ejected
by the volcano of Chiriqui and brought there by the trade-winds which
prevail in Central America.

The Pacific slope, which comes boldly to the water’s edge, is
margined almost throughout by headlands and lofty hills, and has
fewer evidences of extensive denudations and erosions than the
Atlantic coast.

There is also a notable difference between the outlines of the two
coasts. The eastern is regular and slightly concave to the southwest,
while the western is indented with large and small bays and gulfs.

The most northern of these bays is the Salinas, belonging partly
to Nicaragua and partly to Costa Rica. It is a spacious deep-water
harbor, overlooked by the volcanic peak of Orosi. It is separated
from the adjoining bay, the Santa Elena, by Sacate Point.

Continuing south, we come, south of Cacique Point, to Port Culebra,
which is a mile wide, with a depth of eighteen fathoms. At the outlet
of this harbor lies Cocos Bay, capacious enough for a thousand ships
to anchor in the roadstead. The coast line south of Cocos Bay,
bordered by numerous and lofty hills and cut into gorges by small
impetuous water courses, presents no harbor as far as Cape Blanco,
which is at the western entrance of the extensive Gulf of Nicoya. The
gulf extends fifty miles to the northwest and is a magnificent sheet
of water, surrounded by green scenery, rivaling, if not surpassing,
that of the Bay of Naples, the Bosphorus, or the harbor of Rio de
Janeiro. Some twenty islands, large and small, nearly all bold,
rocky and covered with vegetation, contribute to its beauty, while
many small rivers, draining the slopes of the Miravalles and Tilaran
sierras and the mountains of the peninsula of Nicoya, flow into it
and diversify the scenery. The principal river, the Tempisque, enters
at the head of the gulf, and with numerous small branches irrigates
much of the province of Guanacaste.

All of the streams have bars at their mouths, composed generally of
mud and broken shells, and but few of them are navigable even for
a short distance inland, and then by very small craft. The whole
eastern part of the peninsula of Nicoya is broken into hills and
low mountains, wild and rarely cultivated, although there are many
beautiful and fertile valleys. The west side of the gulf is full of
reefs, rocks, violent currents, eddies that run from one to three
and a half miles an hour, and is subject to violent squalls coming
from the northwestern sierras. The eastern shore is less beset by
obstructions, and small craft go along it with ease, and at high tide
penetrate a few of its many rivers. It rises rapidly a short distance
inland, but is at times bordered by mangrove swamps.

Near the mouth of the river Aranjuez, on a sand spit three miles
long, stands Puntarenas, the only port of entry of Costa Rica on the
Pacific coast, and which had, from 1814 until recently, nearly the
entire foreign trade of the country. Ocean vessels anchor from one to
two miles off in the roadstead. There is an iron pier for loading and
discharging.

From Puntarenas southward to the unnavigable Barranca River there is
a broad beach lying at the foot of the high escarpment of Caldera.

The Rio Grande de Tarcoles, which enters the gulf south of the
Barranca, has a dangerous bar, but once inside it may be navigated
a few miles. Its upper waters irrigate the table-land of San José,
Alajuela and Heredia. In the neighborhood of these towns is garnered
nearly the entire coffee crop of Costa Rica. The coast line south
is rocky and precipitous until near Punta Mala, or Judas, at the
southeastern mouth of the gulf, and is low and surrounded by reefs
and rocks.

From Point Judas, low and covered with mangrove swamps, the coast
trends southeast in a long angular curve for about one hundred marine
miles to Point Llorena. It is dominated by lofty hills, cut through
at intervals by short impetuous streams and a few estuaries. The only
safe and excellent anchorage in this one hundred miles is Uvita Bay,
behind a rocky reef. From the precipitous headline, called Punta
Llorena, to Burica Point, the southern limit of Costa Rica, the coast
is abrupt, soon rising into ridges and peaks from 300 to 700 meters
high (985 to 2300 feet). These give birth to a few short turbulent
streams. About half way between these two points the great Golfo
Dulce, having a main width of six miles, penetrates inland northwest
about twenty-eight miles. It has an average depth of one hundred
fathoms.

Cape Matapalo, which marks its western entrance, is deep and
forest-covered, but Banco Point, opposite to it, is low. At the head
of the gulf is found the little Bay of Rincon. From here to the
Esquinas River, at the northeast angle of the gulf, the shore is
hilly, and thence to the harbor of Golfito, which is surrounded by
high hills, the country rises rapidly inland, but between Golfito
and the entrance to the gulf it is lower and less broken, and thence
to Platanal Point and Burica Point, the coast is bold, the country
descending gradually from the northeast.

From Point Llorena to Point Burica the coast is wild and almost
uninhabited. The coasts of Golfo Dulce have but a few hundred
half-breeds as their sole occupants.

There are but two rivers in the long coast line from the Gulf of
Nicoya to the Golfo Dulce, the Rio Grande de Pirris, and the Rio
Grande de Terraba, the head waters of the former flowing through
deep canyons with steep sides, which are almost bare of vegetation
until the region of Guaitil is reached, where dense forests are
encountered. The valley of the Rio Grande de Terraba is one of
the most beautiful, extensive and fertile of Costa Rica, but is
occupied by only a few families. Formerly it was the home of a large
indigenous population.

In the angle made by the River Buena Vista and Chirripo there is a
vast ancient cemetery, the graves of which contain many ornaments of
gold, principally eagles. An ancient road runs by near this place.

Turning to the hydrographic basin of the San Juan River and Lake
Nicaragua, the northeastern slope of the Miravalles range is found to
send off several small streams to the lake.

Between Cuajiniquil, two and one-fourth miles east of Rio Sapoa, and
Tortuga, six miles further east, are the little streams, Lapita, El
Cangrejo, Puente de Piedra, La Vivora, Guabo, Genizaro and Tortuga,
the latter the greatest in volume, being about one hundred and sixty
feet wide at its mouth and navigable. In the further distance of
seventeen miles going east, we cross the rivers Zavalos, Cañitas,
Quesera, Mena, Mico, Sapotillo, Quijada, Quijadita, Santa Barbara,
Sardinia, Barreal, Cañas, Perrito and, finally, Las Haciendas
which is navigable by small boats. From here to San Carlos, at the
outlet of Lake Nicaragua, the distance is sixty-four kilometers,
and the principal rivers which cross this tract are El Pizote,
Papalusco, Guacolito, Zapote, Caño Negro and Rio Frio. The Rio Frio
is of considerable magnitude, and with its many branches drains a
large area of the territory lying on the slopes of the volcanoes
of Miravalles and Tenorio. It pours much sedimentary matter into
Lake Nicaragua, and has thrown an extensive mudbank across the lake
entrance to the River San Juan.

For three or four miles above the mouth of the River Frio the lands
are low and swampy. Several of its branches can be reached and
navigated by canoe, and even a small river steamer can ascend a few
miles from the lake.

The San Carlos River joins the San Juan sixty-five miles from Lake
Nicaragua. The depth of its mouth, which is obstructed by a sand-bar,
varies from eight to twenty feet, according to the season.

The San Carlos has numerous affluents which at times have a volume of
water altogether disproportionate to their lengths. The distance up
to the first rapid of the San Carlos River, which is at El Muelle de
San Rafael where there are from four to six feet of water is roughly
fixed at sixty-two miles by the course of the river. Small steamers
could reach this point, although with difficulty on account of many
snags. The floods sometimes rise to their full height in twenty-four
hours and carry with them a great number of trees and much sand, from
which floating islands are formed.

Should the plans of Engineer Menocal for the Nicaragua Canal be
realized, the waters of the upper San Juan and the lower San Carlos
would be impounded and form an arm of Lake Nicaragua, which would
flood a large area in Costa Rica. The interval between the San Carlos
and the River Frio is an extensive forest, covering an undulating
plain with occasional low hills and watered by numerous little
streams. This territory is fertile and beautiful.

The next great river, the Sarapiqui, reaches the San Juan about
twenty miles east of San Carlos. It is 600 feet wide at its mouth,
and has numerous affluents from the sides of the volcanoes Poas,
Barba and Irazú, the principal ones being the Toro Amarilla and
Sardinal from the west, and the River Sucio from the east. The river
is navigable for large canoes up to its confluence with the Puerto
Viejo. Its banks as high up as to the River Sucio are low. The lands
are extremely fertile. El Muelle Nuevo is the head of navigation,
forty-five miles from the River San Juan and sixty-six miles by the
road across the mountains from San José.

From the Sarapiqui River to the River Colorado, a branch or bayou of
the San Juan, the banks of the latter in Costa Rica are but slightly
elevated. The lands are low and swampy, but occasionally a hill is
found from fifteen to eighteen feet high.

Below the Machuca Rapids the San Juan River is broad and deep as far
as the junction with its Colorado outlet, about seventeen miles from
the sea. Here it turns about nine-tenths of its volume of water into
the Colorado. It is navigable for river steamers at all seasons, but
has a dangerous bar at its mouth where the sea breaks heavily, and on
which there are only from eight to nine feet of water.

From the Colorado Junction to Greytown, some twenty miles distant,
the San Juan averages about three hundred feet in width for sixteen
miles and 100 feet for the remaining four, with a depth at high water
of from six to eight feet.

The Colorado has several islands in its course, but has excellent
anchorage at its mouth. This river forms several lagoons which
communicate with each other by caños or bayous perfectly navigable,
the principal being the Agua Dulce, a short distance from the sea,
eleven miles in length, 800 feet in width and from ten to forty feet
in depth.

Passing from the difficult Caño de la Palma in the midst of swamps,
the Caño de Tortuguero is reached, the entrance to which from the
sea is called Cuatro Esquinas. It is approximately thirty-eight
miles long, about one thousand feet in width, with a depth of from
fifty to sixty feet. The rivers Palacio and Penetencia, navigable
for boats, empty into this caño. The River Tortuguero, which gives
name to the plains watered by its affluents, is formed from several
of these caños, as the Caño Desenredo, Caño Agua Fria and Caño de la
Lomas. The Caño de Tortuguero communicates with the Parismina by the
caños California and Francisco Moria Soto, which are also navigable.
The margins of the Parismina are swampy. It has as its affluents the
Guasimo, Camaron, Novillos and the Destierro.

The lower district drained by the Tortuguero is raised but little
above the ocean, and in flood time the river communicates by several
caños with the Matina and with the delta of the Colorado, as well as
with the lagoon of Caiman, lying south of the Colorado. Its numerous
upper streams rise in the spurs of Irazú and Turialba.

The Sierpe and Parismina rivers flow into the sea south of
Tortuguero. The former is short, but the Parismina with its several
branches is a child of Irazú. Its lower course is sometimes
considered to be a part of the River Reventazon, which however has
its confluence with the former a few miles from the sea.

The Reventazon River has carved its way to a profound depth around
the south and southeastern bases of Irazú and Turialba, and, flanking
the latter volcano, it turns northward to join the Parismina. It
receives many tributaries from the northern slope of the Talamanca
range, and interweaves its head waters with those of the Rio Grande
de Tarcolles and the Rio Grande de Pirris, which flow into the
Pacific Ocean.

The Pacuare River, once known as Suerre, enters the sea about half
way between the mouth of the Reventazon and that of the Matina.
Its waters, in 1630, instead of flowing to the sea, joined the
Reventazon, closing the port of Suerre, but in 1651 Governor Salinas
closed the northern channel, deflecting its waters and restoring the
port.

The Matina River is a short stream with a large volume of water,
which enters the sea just north of Port Limon near the roadstead of
Moin, where, up to 1880, ocean craft anchored. The River Matina is
navigable by small steamers over the bar and by large ones above
the bar to the point where it receives its principal affluents,
the Chirripo, Barbilla and Zent. It yearly overflows its lower
valley, depositing an inch or two of exceedingly fertile mud highly
appreciated by the banana planters.

The entire mainland of the coast, from the River Colorado to the
Matina, is separated from the Caribbean Sea by a continuous narrow
sand bank, between which and the mainland is a lagoon, said to be
navigable the whole distance by boats. The intermediate rivers pour
into this narrow lagoon, driving their currents across it, and,
cutting through the sand bank, enter the sea. Sometimes a violent
gale closes one of the openings, which are all shallow, but the
river again forces an exit to the ocean through the obstruction.
This whole coast for sixty-five miles, is forbidding and dangerous,
and has but little depth of water within a mile of the shore, upon
which a monotonous, heavy surf breaks during the entire year. It is
only frequented from April until August by fishermen, who find their
way to the River San Juan through the intricate system of rivers and
caños described.

Port Limon, in latitude 10° north and longitude 83° 3′ 13″ west from
Greenwich, is the only port of entry of Costa Rica on the Caribbean
Sea. The first house was built there in 1871. The harbor faces
the south, and is formed by a little peninsula on which Limon is
situated. It is behind a narrow coral reef. The site, which now has
perhaps 3500 to 4000 population, is being raised with earth about
four feet, and its port will become one of the smoothest of the
Caribbean Sea. A small island, called Uvita, lies east at a distance
of 3660 feet from the town. Port Limon has a wooden pier 930 feet
long, accommodating two sea-going ships, but an iron pier is about to
replace it, which will berth four large ones of deep draught.

The Talamanca coast lying south of Limon is low, flat and swampy,
except where it is broken by hills. The little River Banana is
the first one met with going south, and its valleys produce large
quantities of timber and bananas. Next comes the Estrella, also a
short stream; then follows the Teliri, called in its lower course the
Sicsola. It is the largest stream in Costa Rica south of Port Limon.
It runs along the southern base of the great eastern mountains of the
Talamanca range, through a spacious, undulating, wooded valley of 100
to 150 square miles area, partly low grounds in some places dry and
in others swampy. It has several branches, like the Uren coming from
the slopes of the Pico Blanco, the Supurio and others. At the entry
of the high valleys of the Teliri and Coen rivers, the pyramid-like
mountains of Nefomin and Nenfiobete appear, at the foot of which the
interior plain of Talamanca, fifteen kilometers in length and eight
kilometers in width, extends from southwest to northeast, and so
uniformly that the water courses run indifferently and frequently
change their beds.

Southward of Sicsola is the Tilorio or Changuinola, which makes a
turbulent way to the sea from the Talamanca mountains. Along its
lower margin mud flats spread to a great width, and, from its mouth
towards the northwest, cover a region which surrounds also the lagoon
of Sansan, and extends up the rivers Zhorquin and Sicsola. Behind the
muddy zone the lands rise rapidly into hills, which in a few miles
reach an altitude of several thousand feet, at times intermingling
with the Cordillera. Along the entire sea margin of Talamanca runs a
narrow sand-belt of firm land, at times not a hundred feet wide, like
that described between the Matina and San Juan rivers.

Within this sand-belt are long, narrow, deep lagoons filled with
half-stagnant water from the mud flats. These lagoons usually open
into the rivers which descend from the mountains.

Between the Sicsola and the Tilorio lies the already mentioned,
crooked and deep lagoon called the Laguna de Sansan.

At Limon, Cahuita and Puerto Viejo, the hills, which are connected by
spurs with the more elevated country of the interior, extend to the
ocean coast. Between them, in plains extending from one to five miles
inland, are forest-covered swamps, overflowed with not less than ten
feet of water in the rainy season and only traversable in the dry.

Costa Rica claims sovereignty on the Atlantic side southeast as far
as the Island of Escudo de Veragua, including the ancient Ducado de
Veragua, whose frontier follows the coast of Chiriqui Viejo to the
crest of the Cordillera, and crosses it to the head waters of the
River Calobebora, then down this stream to the Escudo de Veragua.

Since their independence Colombia and Costa Rica have been in dispute
in regard to their boundary line. Colombia has never ceased to claim
jurisdiction over the entire Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, and
even over that of Nicaragua as far north as Cape Gracias á Dios. In
November, 1896, both governments signed a convention submitting their
dispute to the arbitration of the President of the French Republic,
or, in the event of his failure to act, to the President of Mexico or
of the Swiss Confederation.

The principal lakes of Costa Rica are the Laguna Manatí, northwest
from the Sarapiqui River; the Lagunas de Poas and de Barba, each on
a volcano bearing its name; Lagunas de Sansan and Samay, towards the
east and near the Sicsola River, in Talamanca; Laguna Tenoria, in
Guanacaste; Laguna San Carlos, in the plains of San Carlos; Laguna de
Arenal, between Las Cañas and San Carlos, and Laguna de Sierpe, in
the south, northward from the Golfo Dulce.

Far away from Costa Rica, in the Pacific Ocean, lies the Cocos
Island, about two hundred and sixty-six miles to the southwest of the
Golfo Dulce, in N. latitude 5° 32′ 57″ and longitude 86° 58′ 25″ W.
of Greenwich. Its highest point reaches 2250 feet, whence the descent
is gradual to a bold, steep coast, which has many irregularities and
rocks and a surf-beaten shore. Chatham Bay is its best harbor, having
room for a dozen ships. The interior is broken into numerous fertile
valleys, but there is probably not a square kilometer of level ground
in the entire island. Other islands are Chira, Venado, San Lucas,
Caño, etc.


_Mineral Wealth._—In regard to the mineral wealth of Costa Rica,
petroleum has been discovered near Uruchiko on the Talamanca coast,
and coal in certain sandstone formations on both the Atlantic and
Pacific sides of the Talamanca section.

In the province of Alajuela, a little to the north of the cart-road
which runs from San José to Puentarenas, is Monte Aguacate, part
of an old mountain range which extends far to the northwest, and
not very distant from the Gulf of Nicoya. In general, it is of
metamorphic formation, principally of diorite and porphyry.

Here, in a good climate, at 2000 feet elevation, are found auriferous
veins of great richness. They are of quartz mixed with decomposed
feldspathic rocks, and have yielded very lucrative bonanzas. The
first mine was Guapinol, one bonanza of which produced $1,000,000.
Several other mines were worked, from one of which (Los Castros)
$2,000,000 were taken in a few years. It is estimated, from the best
data obtainable, that about £1,000,000 have been taken from Monte
Aguacate. Several of these veins are from six to seven feet wide, but
that called the Quebrada Honda is sixteen feet wide. Most of the ore
is of a high grade and of refractory character. It is probable that
the whole southwestern slope of the Guatusos and Miravalles ranges of
mountains is auriferous. The rocks in the northwestern extension of
this district consist principally of feldspar, porphyry, basalt and
dolorite.

The gold veins nearly all ran northeast and southwest, and are
encased in feldspar, sometimes in porphyry, and occasionally in
basalt. They consist, in great part, of crystalline quartz, and are
from two to forty feet wide. Professor Pittier also found gold in
the slopes of the Buena Vista mountain. Gold is further found in the
Talamanca mountains, especially in the placer grounds of the Duedi
River, and on the inferior hills between the Lari and Coen rivers.

Along the latter, and near Akbeta, also on the shore of Puerto Viejo,
iron exists.

Copper and silver, Professor Pittier says, have been discovered in
Diquis, between Paso Real and Lagarto, and native copper in Puriscal.
Other mines are included in the following table:

It should be stated that, with the exception of gold and some silver,
little is mined. The deposits of coal, petroleum, copper and silver
have thus far yielded, under present methods of management, outputs
of no commercial value.

However, anthracite is found at Santa Maria Dota, Department of
Puriscal. A specimen of it, analyzed by Dr. L. J. Mátos, chief of
the laboratories of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum, gave these
results:

It is a good quality of anthracite coal and compares very favorably
with the best grades that are mined in Pennsylvania. Color, black;
slight tendency to show iridescence; fracture, conchoidal, brittle;

There are to be mentioned also some mineral waters, as, for instance,
those near the mouth of the Isqui River, on the Talamanca coast;
those in Agua Caliente, about five miles from the City of Cartago and
belonging to the Bella Vista Company; those of Orosi and Salitral, of
Poas, Miravalles, Ausoles, Bagaces, San Carlos, Liberia, San Roque,
etc.




II.

CLIMATE OF COSTA RICA.


The climate of Costa Rica depends on its situation in the tropics,
on the position of the sun at different times of the year, and on
the topography, but, owing to the narrowness of the country and its
situation between the two great oceans, it is well-tempered by the
alisios (northeast trades) and other winds.

I begin this chapter with the following table which gives the

  Meteorological Conditions in San José During the Year 1896.

The average atmospheric pressure of San José, the capital of the
country, is 665.21 mm. The maximum occurs regularly during the months
from October to March inclusive, at nine o’clock a. m., and during
the rest of the year at eleven o’clock p. m. The minimum occurs
always in the afternoon at four o’clock during the first eight months
of the year, and at three o’clock during the last four months.

The prevailing wind is from the northeast, or, better,
north-northeast and east. During August, September and October an
increase of the northwest winds causes the heavy rains of that
season. West-northwest and northwest winds blow also from May to
August.

The daily variation of winds is generally as follows:

At seven a. m. the most frequent winds blow from S. E., to N. E.;
at ten o’clock a. m. from E. to N. N. E; at one o’clock and at four
o’clock p. m. from E. N. E. to N.; from seven o’clock p. m. the
movement is retrograde. The velocity is least from seven to ten
o’clock a. m., and most from one to four o’clock p. m.

In 1889, during the time of observations at San José, there were
noted 13 hours of north winds, 186 N. N. E., 571 N. E., 227 E. N. E.,
93 E., 58 E. S. E., 25 S. E., 6 S. S. E., S. none, S. S. W. none, 1
S. W., 3 W. S. W., 4 W., 83 W. N. W.

The number of calms is small. The wind is nearly always moderate,
but during the dry season the dust whirled up in the cities is very
disagreeable. The climate of the uplands is an eternal spring.

The coldest month is January; December and February are relatively
cold. The hottest months are May and June. The heat is, at all
times, moderate and agreeable. The course of the temperature has
all the characters of an insular climate, without having so much
humidity. The oscillation of the average temperature is greatest in
March and during the dry season, as at that time the sky is clear
and the soil exposed to uninterrupted insolation during the day,
while the earth’s radiation of heat during the night is rapid. Also
the daily oscillation is considerable during the dry season, and
continues during the first month of the rainy season, according to
the condition of the sky.

In 1890 the sun shone in San José 1911 hours, that is an average of
five hours and fourteen minutes per day. February is the month of
most sunshine and least nebulosity. The hour of most sunshine during
the year is that between eight and nine a. m., and that of the least
is in the afternoon.

The oscillation of the temperature of the soil is, at a depth of
one meter, 2, 13° C., per year. At a depth of three meters, the
temperature of the soil is lowest in February and March, when it is
20, 48° C., and highest in August, when it is 20, 75° C.

The daily variation is almost nothing during the first three months
of the year, and the sky is relatively clear, while, from May to
October, not one day is clear. During the hottest hours of the day
the sky begins regularly to be darkened by clouds, due to ascending
atmospheric currents.

In San José the sky is ordinarily clear between midnight and noon,
even during the most rainy months, and cloudy the rest of the
twenty-four hours. Although the rainfalls are abundant here from May
to October, with rare exceptions they do not last more than a few
hours each day. The mornings are generally splendid and the air very
pure, and nearly every day the sunset can be clearly observed.

From May to November there are about two hours of copious rain daily
between one and four o’clock in the afternoon, averaging, with great
regularity, from ten to twelve inches a month, and from seventy to
eighty inches during the year. Towards the end of June there is a
short dry period called “Veranillo de San Juan.”

Through the Desengaño and Palma Passes the northern rains penetrate
a short distance every day, and the northern descent of the Palma
towards Carillo is probably the most rainy district of the Republic.

At Tres Rios, having an elevation of 4140 feet, six miles east of San
José, at the western foot of the Ochomogo Pass, the rain record for
126 days out of ten months showed a fall of 100 inches, while at San
José, during the same period of ten months there were 147 rainy days,
with a fall of eighty-four inches. In the month of May Professor
Pittier, to whom we owe these excellent data, measured nine inches in
rainfall in one and one-half hours.

The daily curve of rainfall shows a minimum very accentuated in the
first half of the day. Rain begins to fall about eleven o’clock,
and continues to augment rapidly from hour to hour until it reaches
its maximum between four and five o’clock p. m.; from this time on
it diminishes gradually until morning. The daily maximum of rain is
reached about sunset, although in January the heaviest rainfalls are
observed between one and two o’clock p. m. The most probable hour of
rain is between four and five o’clock p. m. It seldom rains between
three and four o’clock, and very seldom during the morning hours.

Thunderstorms reach their maximum in May. The relative humidity of
the air is such that the climate can be considered a favored one.
Its annual curve shows three minima and three maxima. The minima are
observed between February and March, in July, and between November
and December; the maxima in June, September and December. These
lines, of course, are parallel with those indicating the distribution
of rain. The maximum is noted at sunrise, the minimum at two o’clock
p. m., with an average oscillation of twenty-four per cent.

From 1866 to 1880, the rain gauge record kept by Mason at San José
shows a yearly average precipitation of sixty-four and one-fourth
inches, or 1631 millimeters.

It is as follows:

There is every year a number of slight earthquakes in San José,
generally undulating from west to west-northwest, and occurring
mostly between eleven p. m. and six a. m. The greatest number are
observed at the beginning of the rainy season.

The rainy season on the Caribbean slope of the country does not
correspond to that of the Pacific. In fact there are no continuously
dry months, and on the northern declivities of the volcanoes of
Turialba, Irazú, Barba and Poas, it rains more or less during the
entire year; also near Lake Nicaragua it rains nearly continuously,
and the mountains of the Guatuso country and the surroundings of
the volcano of Orosi are seldom without clouds. At times there are
cloud-bursts of tremendous power, broadening rivers for miles. Port
Limon is said to have an annual rainfall of eighty-nine inches, but
it is greatly exceeded by that of Colon, which averages 120 inches.
The mean rainfall at Greytown for 1890, 1891, 1892, was 267 inches
yearly. The late United States Commission estimated the average at
Lake Nicaragua at eighty inches, and in the basin of the San Juan
River at 150 inches.

The climate of Talamanca is for the same reason very unhealthy in the
proximity of the coast, and also in the lower course of the rivers
a similarly deadly climate prevails. In normal years there are two
dry and two wet seasons. The rains commence regularly in May or June
and last until the end of July. The months of August and September
are more or less dry. In October there are some heavy showers, and
extensive rains begin which characterize the months of November,
December and January. The driest months are February, March and
April. The high region is extremely humid, giving rise to fogs and
rains. The mosses which almost completely envelop the stems of the
trees are constantly dropping water, and the rivers in this section
are almost impassable.

The climate of the great valley of the Rio Grande de Terraba is
similar to that described for the terrace lands. Both regions have
distinctly marked characters. Rains begin in April, grow heavier
towards September, and cease about the end of November. During the
rest of the year dry weather prevails, although sometimes heavy
showers relieve this arid condition. In the lower zone pronounced
radiation causes a heavy dew and extensive fogs, and both are
characteristic of this section.

The excessive heat felt on the lowlands diminishes gradually with the
rising of the land towards the high mountains, but at times a height
of 1500 feet will be found cooler than one of 3000 feet. In the Santa
Clara district, for instance, it is cooler at 500 feet elevation than
it is in the Reventazon valley at 1500 feet. In general, the torrid
lands of the country, ranging from the sea to 150 feet above it, and,
if not clear and well-drained, even up to 400 and 500 feet, abound
in malarial fevers; but as high ground, having an elevation of from
1500 to 3000 feet is reached, the fevers are of light type and not
dangerous, while from 3000 to 5000 feet the diseases are those of
the temperate zone, and are due less to local conditions of soil and
climate than to personal neglect.

There were no epidemic diseases in 1897. In October 30, 1894, sixteen
medical districts were established by law, and so were a number of
hospitals and quarantine stations in the ports of the Republic.




III.

CHARACTER OF VEGETATION.


This chapter I begin with a phyto-geographical classification
given by Dr. Carl Hoffman and published in Bonplandia in 1858. He
distinguishes:

  First.—Coast regions (sea shores and salt swamps).

  Second.—Regions of tropical forests and savannas, stretching from
  the coast regions to a height of 900 meters.

  Third.—Regions of high plains, lying between 900 to 1500 meters of
  elevation.

  Fourth.—Region of upper tropical forests, situated between 1500 to
  2150 meters of altitude.

  Fifth.—Region of oaks, from 2150 to 2750 meters in height.

  Sixth.—Region of chaparrales, from 2750 to 3050 meters up.

  Seventh.—Region of subalpine or subandine flora, from 3050 meters
  up to the tops of the high mountains.

Dr. Polakowsky enumerates cultivated lands, virgin forests, open
forests and savannas.

Another division is given by Dr. Moritz Wagner. He mentions a
littoral (as appears on next page) zone, a tropical forest zone and a
zone of savannas.

He also distinguishes on the volcano of Chiriqui the following
successive regions:

  First.—Regions of evergreen forest trees and palms, bananas,
  Araceæ, etc., to a height of 550 meters, with an average
  temperature of 26° to 24° C.

  Second.—Region of tree ferns and mountain orchids, from 550 to 1220
  meters, with an average temperature of 23° to 18° C.

  Third.—Region of Rosaceæ, Senecionodeæ, Gramineæ and Agave
  americana, from 1220 to 1585 meters.

  Fourth.—Region of Cupuliferæ and Betulaceæ, mostly oaks and alders,
  from 1585 to 3050 meters.

  Fifth.—Higher region above 3050 meters.

Dr. Wagner calls special attention to a noted uniformity of the flora
on the coasts of both oceans, and Professor Pittier affirms that
the vegetation between Colon and Greytown on one side, and between
Panama and San Juan del Sur on the other side, is remarkably uniform.
The littoral zone has a width of about four maritime miles. The
predominating flora is composed of _Rhizophora mangle_, _Hippomane
mancinella_, _Cocos nucifera_, _Chrysobalanus icaco_, _Crescentia
cujete_, _Acacia spadicigera_, _Cæsalpinia bonducella_ and other
_Leguminosæ_; _Acrostichum aureum_, _Ipomœa pescapræ_, _Avicennia
nitida_, _Uniola Pittierii_ and also _Euphorbiaceæ_, etc.

The zone of tropical forests shows, especially on the Atlantic
side behind the coast region, a strip of from twenty to twenty-two
miles in width, with lofty trees of _Rubiaceæ_, _Myrtaceæ_,
_Melastomaceæ_, _Sterculiaceæ_, _Euphorbiaceæ_, _Meliaceæ_,
_Urticaceæ_, _Moraceæ_, _Anacardiacæ_, _Sapindaceæ_, _Leguminosæ_ and
_Palmæ_. It is relatively free from ligneous undergrowth, having more
monocotyledonous plants, such as _Cycadeæ_, _Scitamineæ_, _Cannaceæ_,
_Marantaceæ_, _Cyperaceæ_, _Filices_ and _Bromeliaceæ_, underneath.
The latter orders figure, also with _Orchideæ_ and _Loranthaceæ_
among the epiphytes and parasites which cover the trees. Among
the most characteristic plants of this region we name the coyol
palm (_Acrocomia_), corozo (_Attalea cohune_), biscoyol (_Bactris
horrida_), palmiche (_Elæis melanococca_) and _Raphia nicaraguensis_
which forms almost forests along the River San Juan; further, _Tecoma

_Copaifera_, _Cedrela_, _Swietenia_, _Sapota_, _Pithecolobium_,
_Palicourea_, _Cinchona_, _Piper_, _Ficus_, _Cecropia_; still
further, smilax, vanilla, etc. Many of these characteristic plants
are largely social, such as the piper, ferns, palms and others.

Moritz Wagner states that all along the southern limits of Costa
Rica a likeness of climatic and geological conditions gives to the
vegetation a nearly uniform character, while further northward a
notable contrast is observed between the Atlantic and Pacific slopes
of the mountain groups and on the interior terrace lands. The
Atlantic slope, with more constant humidity of air, is characterized
by vast, dense, evergreen, virgin forests, while the Pacific lands,
with a relatively dry climate and rainless summer, present more open
forests and savannas, with many deciduous trees and shrubs. However,
deep river valleys and some slopes near the water-shed have dense,
evergreen forests, and their vegetation does not differ much from
that of the Atlantic slope. The flora of the high terrace lands has
been so altered by thorough cultivation as to have almost lost its
original character.

The Atlantic virgin forests, as well as those in the region of the
San Juan River and of Lake Nicaragua, which comprise two-thirds of
Costa Rican territory, show such a dense vegetation that its interior
can be penetrated almost only by way of the rivers, and its general
character and its enormous extension be studied only from high
mountains. Owing to the very mountainous character of the country,
over half of its area lies between 900 and 2100 meters above the sea,
and is almost wholly covered with virgin forest. This forest here
and there ascends still higher, reaching the upper limit of the oak
region about 2700 meters above the sea.

Dr. Polakowsky, in an interesting publication entitled “Flora of
Costa Rica,” calls the forest region of the San Juan River, in view
of its luxuriant character, “The Central American Hylæa,” and this
name Professor Pittier applies also to the entire Atlantic region,
attributing to it a distinctly South American character.

The zone of the open forests and savannas, which has park-like
features, is rarely found away from the Pacific side, where it forms
a belt from sixteen to eighteen miles in width, interspersed with
more densely forested river valleys, islands of higher and thicker
virgin forests, isolated trees or groups of trees, sometimes also
with _catingas_ and meadows flecked with shrubs and matorrales.

The savannas and open forests spread to a considerable extent over
Guanacaste, where they are a continuation of those of Rivas in
Nicaragua; also over the plains of Terraba, especially in the region
of Buenos Aires and Terraba; and over the coast-lands of Golfo Dulce.
There are some small similar tracts near Alajuela, Turialba, Santa
Clara and at some other points, as well as catingas and _paramos_ in
the high mountain ridges of the south. The paramos are found on poor
soil and have a vegetation more herbaceous than ligneous, which, when
moist, takes on the character of turf.

The trees of the savannas are generally of little height, excepting
the _Enterolobium cyclocarpum_ (the guanacaste), the pochote and
ceiba. The grass lands are almost wholly composed of _Gramineæ_
and _Cyperaceæ_, especially in the savannas of Guanacaste. The
most characteristic plants are _Digitaria marginata_ and _Paspalum
notatum_, besides species of _Setaria_, _Panicum_, _Eragrostis_,
_Andropogon_, _Isolepis_, _Cyperus_, _Rhynchospora_ and _Scleria_, as
well as of ferns (_Pteris aquilina_) and _Schizæa occidentalis_.

Other abundant plants in the open forests and savannas are
_Compositæ_ (_Zemenia_, _Pectis_, _Spilanthes_); _Rubiaceæ_
(_Spermacoce_); _Polygalaceæ_; _Iridaceæ_; _Moraceæ_ (_Maclura_,
_Ficus_); _Melastomaceæ_ (_Miconia_, _Clidemia_, _Conostegia_,
_Leandra_); _Cyperaceæ_; _Convolvulaceæ_; _Euphorbiaceæ_;
_Bombacaceæ_; _Sauvagesia_. Further, _Myrtaceæ_ (_Psidium_,
_Alibertia edulis_); _Curatella americana_ (chamico); _Roupala_
(danto hedliondo); _Byrsonima crassifolia_ (nance); _Miconia argentea
DC._ (santa maria); guacimo macho (_Luhea_), guacimo de ternero
(_Guazuma ulmifolia_); burio (_Bombax apeiba_); ñambar (_Cocobola_);
_Davilla lucida_; _Duranta Plumieri_; _Proteaceæ_; and _Acacia
scleroxyla Lonchocarpus atropurpureus,_ _Dalbergia_ and many other
_Leguminosæ_, especially _Mimosa pudica_, which gives large tracts in
many places a special character, and still more so as, being often
very abundant and the plants tangled together, a general movement all
around is caused when one is touched.

Among the epiphytes and parasites may be mentioned small ferns,
_Peperomia_, _Epidendrum_, _Loranthus_, _Aroideæ_, _Tillandsia_ and
other _Bromeliaceæ_, mosses, lichens, etc.

Professor Pittier attributes to this flora of the Pacific slope a
more northern origin.

During the dry season the vegetation of the savannas almost
disappears, the greater part of the trees and bushes shed their
leaves and herbs become dry and brittle. Only along the rivers is
some freshness observable. Toward the border of Nicaragua cacti
appear, mostly species of _Cereus_, _Opuntia_, _Phypsalis_ and
_Mammilaria_. Professor Pittier also mentions an oak forest of
_Quercus citrifolia_ between Liberia and the Rio de los Ahogados, at
a height of about one hundred meters above the sea. The peninsula
of Nicoya is noted for a large lumber industry among its different
cedars (_Cedro dulce_, _C. amargo_, _C. real_, etc.), mora and other
trees. Towards the upper limits of the Atlantic tropical forests,
below the oak region, _Chamædorea_, _Geonoma_, _Bactris_, _Euterpe
longepetiolata_ and other palms of the same groups, as well as
_Gulielma utilis_ (the pijivalle palm) and _Carludovica microphylla_
are seen in great abundance, mixed with tree ferns like _Alsophylla
pruinata_, _Hemitelia horrida_, _Hemitelia grandifolia_, etc. Higher
up appears the region of oaks, principally _Quercus retusa_, _Quercus
granulata_, _Quercus citrifolia_ and _Quercus costaricensis_, with
_Buddleia alpina_, _Rubus_, _Lupinus_, etc. Here is also the region
of the common potato. This oak region slopes gradually down from
east to west. The vegetation on the summits of the high mountains
of Costa Rica is of a marked subalpine character, having a great
number of northern genera, as _Vaccinium_, _Pernettya_, _Alchemilla_,
_Cardamine_, _Calceolaria_, _Spiræa_, etc.

Certain types of vegetation are often more due to the sterile nature
of the soil than to elevation.

Although a northern flora is frequent on the high terraces of San
José and Cartago, that character is not general because of the
introduction of cultivated tropical and other plants peculiar to
Costa Rica.

On the southern high mountains two species of _Podocarpus_ (_P.
taxifolia_ and _P. salicifolia_), one of _Alnus_ (_Alnus Mirbelii
Spach._) and one of _Weinmannia_ occur quite generally among the
oak forests. Other distinct floral groups are represented by the
vegetation along roads and fences, on potreros, in cultivated regions
and along river shores. The latter especially are rich in herbaceous
plants, grasses, bushes and woods of _Bignoniaceæ_, _Myrtaceæ_,
_Euphorbiaceæ_, _Mimoseæ_, etc.

The potreros are characterized by _Tagetes_, _Sida_, _Hyptis,
olanum_, _Salvia_, _Mimosa pudica_ and _M. sensitiva_, etc. Along
fences there grow nearly everywhere _Erythrina corallodendron_,
_Yucca aloifolia_, _Bromelia pinguin_, _Agave americana_, _Cereus_,
_Spondias_, _Bursera_, _Cestrum_, etc.

Prominent characteristic plants, besides the already mentioned
species and genera, are the _Piperaceæ_ and _Melastomaceæ_; further,
species of _Iriartea_, _Bactris_ and _Raphia_ of the palm order,
and _Alsophylla_, _Schizæa occidentalis_ and _Pteris aquilina_
of the ferns; still further _Castilloa costaricana_, _Gunnera
insignis_, _Ochroma lagopus_, _Gliciridia_, _Inga edulis_, _Chusquea
maurofernandeziana_, _Erythrina corallodendron_, _Drymis Winterii
Forst._, _Acacia Farnesiana_, etc.

The passage from one flora to another is one of insensible
gradations. Cultivated lands, as already stated, do not show any
longer the original vegetation.

The plants which are now mostly cultivated are: _Coffea arabica_
(coffee), _Saccharum officinarum_ (sugar cane), _Zea mays_ (corn),
_Musa paradisiaca_ and _Musa sapientium_ (bananas), _Phaseolus_
(beans), _Oryza sativa_ (rice), _Solanum tuberosum_ (potato),
_Nicotiana tabacum_ (tobacco), _Batatas dulcis_ (sweet potato),
_Lycopersicum esculentum_ and _Lycopersicum Humboldtii_ (tomatoes),
_Capsicum annuum_ (chile), _Ananas sativa_ (pine-apple), _Carica
papaya_ (papaya), _Persea gratissima_ (aguacate), _Anona cherimolia_
(cherimoya), _Manihot aipi_ and _Manihot utilissima_ (yucca or
mandioca), _Indigofera anil_ (indigo), _Gossypium barbadense_
(cotton), _Cichorium Intyous_ (chicory), _Asparagus officinalis_
(asparagus), _Psidium guava_ (guayaba), _Mammea americana_ (mamey),
_Theobroma cacao_ (cacao), etc.

Before giving the lists of the woods, tannings, dyeings, gums,
balsams, resins, rubber, waxes, textile and medicinal plants, oils
and oil seeds, etc., of Costa Rica, it is advantageous to research
to name those collectors and scientists who, having traveled
through Costa Rica or established themselves there, have especially
contributed to the knowledge of the natural resources of the country.

IV.

FAUNA.


In regard to the _fauna_, there are in Costa Rica about one hundred
and twenty-one species of mammalia, of which ten are domesticated and
four of _Mus_ introduced, leaving 107 as indigenous to Costa Rica.

There are only a few species peculiar to Costa Rica, and also but
a small number peculiar to Central America, among which are the
_Tapirus dowi alston_ and three species of monkeys. About one-fifth
of the total number also belong to South America and one-seventh
to North America. The rest are found as well in North as in South
America. With respect to the avifauna, there are 725 known species.
This great variety of the avifauna is due to especial climatic
conditions, to the very rich flora, to the geographical position
between two oceans and to the vicinity of so many islands of the
Caribbean Sea.

It is composed of 67 Neoarctic species, which are also found in the
north of Mexico; of 247 Neotropical or South American species, of
260 autochthonous or exclusively Central American species, and 128
newly described species which live as well in the northern as in the
southern continent. The rest, comprising 23 species, have a doubtful
origin. The best singing birds are the Gilguero, Yigüerro, Toledo,
Mozotillo, Cacique, Mongita, Comemaiz, Setillero and Agüillo.

There are over 130 species of _Reptilia_ and _Batrachia_ in Costa
Rica. Those known and described are 36 _Batrachia_, 28 _Lacertilia_,
60 _Ophidia_ and 6 _Testudinata_. Poisonous snakes are the Toboba,
Bocaracá, Oropel, Terciopelo and Cascabel.

Costa Rica is also very rich in _Fishes_. Those in the Pacific are
almost entirely different from those of the Atlantic Ocean. Also its
tributary waters have more varied species than those of the Atlantic
slope.

In correspondence with the varied topographical, climatological, and
botanical conditions of Costa Rica is also the _invertebrate fauna_.
And here the National Museum, under Mr. Anastasio Alfaro, and the
“Instituto fisico geografico Nacional.” under Professor H. Pittier,
are doing equally excellent work in bringing them to our knowledge,
as they have done like service in other branches of Natural History.

The most interesting species of the fauna in Costa Rica among the
mammalia are the monkeys (_Mycetes palliatus_, _Ateles geoffroyi_,

V.

THE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS.


Colonel George Earl Church says in regard to the Indians: “There
are many indications that Costa Rica was once the debatable ground
between the powerful Mexican invader and the warlike Caribs of
northern South America.”

“The Caribs were a tall, muscular, copper colored race who, when the
New World was discovered, occupied the coast from the mouth of the
River Orinoco to that of the River Amazon, and stretched inland over
all the half-drowned districts and far up the valley of the Orinoco.
Their nomadic spirit led them to the conquest of many of the Windward
Islands, and, I am disposed to believe, urged them to invade all
the countries bordering the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico having
estuaries and rivers which could be penetrated by their war canoes.
These carried from twenty-five to one hundred men each and were of
sufficient size to make long voyages.”

Along all the Caribbean coast districts of Yucatan, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Chiriqui, and throughout the province of
Panamá, the Carib has left traces of his presence.

It is evident that an offshoot of the highland Mexican race pressed
south and east from Chiapas, Mexico, into and through the long
strip of the Pacific coast occupied by the Chorotegas or Mangues,
followed the Pacific slope of the Cordilleras and the narrow space
between Lake Nicaragua and the Ocean, penetrated into northwestern
Costa Rica, settled and helped the Mangues to develop a considerable
civilization in the district of Guanacaste and Nicoya, and in part
subdued all the volcanic region lying north and west of the valley of
the River Reventazon.

It is notable that inhabitants of volcanic countries crowd around the
slopes of its volcanoes, due probably to the fertilizing quality of
the ejected ash.

The Mexicans have left abundant traces of their language in Costa
Rica, especially throughout its northern half. Many of their words
are now in common use and incorporated into the Spanish spoken
there. Notably such words occur in the names of plants, animals and
geographical localities.

In 1569 the Adelantado Peráfan de Rivera made an elaborate detailed
enumeration of the Indians and found their total number to be 25,000.

Mr. M. de Peralta says the Nahuas (Aztecs) and Mangues (Chorotegas),
Güetares, Viceitas, Térrabas, Changuenes, Guaymies, Quepos, Cotos and
Borucas were the principal people who occupied the territory of Costa
Rica at the time of the conquest. The Nahuas came from the north,
and if the Mangues did not go from Chiapas, it is necessary to infer
that from the Gulf of Nicoya and the shores of the lakes of Nicaragua
and Managua they extended to the south of Mexico, where, up to a few
years ago, their language was spoken at Acalá.

The Mangues, or Chorotegas, at the time of the Mexican invasion,
occupied the peninsula of Nicoya and all the lands surrounding the
gulf of that name. They were then, no doubt, the most powerful and
advanced people in Costa Rica, and carried some of their arts, such
as pottery, sculpture, weaving, and tilling the ground, to greater
perfection than any people occupying the region between their
territory and that of the Chibcas on the table-land of Colombia.
In their graves are found gold ornaments and specimens of the
ceramic art showing taste in design superior to any that the present
civilized Costa Rican Indian can manufacture. These graves also
contain beautiful specimens of obsidian, greenstone and even finely
wrought jade tools and jade ornaments, knives, axes, arrowheads,
amulets, rings and a multitude of stone idols, seats, etc. The
Mangues appear to have manufactured gold extensively into jewelry.

The Güetares made their homes on the slopes of the Turialba. Irazú
and Barba to the southeast of the Mexicans and Chorotegas, and, in a
less degree, they shared in the skill and advancement of the latter,
but their pottery was inferior in artistic method and quality of
material and workmanship, judging from collections in the National
Museum of Costa Rica.

Peralta says, “The Nahuas and Mangues of the regions of Nicoya have
completely disappeared, although the first still survive in Mexico,
and the latter are represented here and there by a descendant in
Masava (Nicaragua) and in Acalá (Chiapas).” The Nahuas (Aztecs)
left notable monuments of their material civilization and of their
scientific attainments, and a language that served as the instrument
of a cultivated and thoughtful race.

During the colonial period the Spaniards, in several efforts to
explore the River Frio, were driven back by the Guatuso Indians, who
still occupy the greater part of its valley and the slopes of the
volcanic mountains. It was not until 1856 that a small expedition
penetrated across the country to the Rio Frio from the mouth of the
River Arenal, a branch of the San Carlos. They reported fertile,
hilly slopes in its upper reaches, and beautiful plains for most of
the distance traversed to its mouth.

The rubber collectors of Nicaragua for many years have ascended the
Rio Frio and other rivers in canoes and plundered the settlements,
plantations and property of the Indians, forcing them to retire
further up the river. The Guatusos live in _palenques_ (stockades),
and their houses are similar to the maloccas among Amazon tribes.
Each palenque shelters several families, who cook their food at
separate fires built on the ground. They live principally on
plantains, yucca, maize, sugar cane, cacao, game and fish, the latter
being abundant in the Rio Frio. They also cultivate and smoke tobacco.

Their weapons are bows, arrows, stone axes, and wooden knives. They
drink _chicha_, made by fermenting roasted green plantains, and also
_chicha mascada de maiz_. As the bishop of Costa Rica, Dr. Bernardo
A. Thiel, a very noted ethnologist and archæologist, says:

“The Guatuso country is probably one of the most delightful portions
of Costa Rica. Every tropical product can be grown there in
abundance, for the lands are immeasurably rich and the climate one of
the best in the tropical belt.”

The last census of the Guatuso Indians is as follows:

Of the Talamanca Indians, Professor H. Pittier distinguishes two
tribes, the Brilio and Cabécar. The first live in the valleys and
mountains of Urén and Arari and along the lower course of the Coen
River, while the Cabécars dwell in the upper parts of the Coen. Other
Indians, probably of the Tiribi tribe, live in the upper part of the
Teliri valley.

The Talamanca Indians have a higher grade of civilization than the
neighboring Boruca or Brunca and Térraba Indians.

The Bribris have good traditions and numerous legends of their past.

The census of the Talamanca Indians is as follows:

  -----------+------+--------+-------+---------
             | Male.| Female.| Total.| Married.
  -----------+------+--------+-------+---------
  Lari       |  263 |   269  |   532 |
  Coen       |  172 |   176  |   348 |    --
  Teliri     |   67 |    71  |   138 |     2
  Urén       |  424 |   393  |   817 |    44
  -----------+------+--------+-------+---------
      Total  |  926 |   909  |  1835 |    50
  -----------+------+--------+-------+---------

The Térrabas and Bruncas or Boruca Indians are located on the Pacific
slope of the Talamanca mountains, and especially in the great valley
of the Diquis or Rio Grande de Térraba, although there are also a few
Indian palenques in the neighborhood of the Chirripo. The Borucas
or Bruncas are dolichocephalic. The men are large, the women short
and plump. They are more intelligent and active than the Tishbi of
Térraba. Professor Pittier counted in the Boruca valley and at Palma,
Punta Mala and La Uvita 65 to 75 ranchos scattered around, with about
389 inhabitants, while he found 50 to 60 ranchos with about 250
inhabitants in the town of Térraba and 25 to 30 ranchos with about
300 inhabitants in the town of Buenos Aires. There are also some
Indians near the Golfo Dulce.

Taken in all, about 4000 uncivilized Indians are estimated to remain
in Costa Rica.




VI.

POPULATION.


The population of Costa Rica is nearly all white and mostly
descendants of Spaniards from Galicia. The Indians are not numerous
and are completely distinct from the civilized race. The Negroes and
mixed breeds live almost exclusively on the coast-lands.

The Costa Ricans are a well formed, robust and healthy people
with regular features. The women are gracious, have splendid eyes
and abundance of hair, and appear affable in manner. The men are
intelligent, industrious, economical, honest and peaceable, as well
as polite, truthful and generous. They respect order and property,
love to work, and are proud of their wealth and of the independence
of their nation.

Every Costa Rican owns property of some kind. The better class of
women follow in their dress the fashions of Europe; the lower classes
have gowns of muslin or calico, and wear petticoats, rebozos and very
often panama hats. Some adorn themselves with earrings and other
jewelry and some wear shoes.

The men dress in European style. The lower class, consisting of
hard-working farmers, owners of small coffee plantations and ox-carts
and oxen for internal traffic, wear coarse cloth coats, drill or
cotton trousers, and straw or felt hats. Most of these people go
barefooted.

The houses of the wealthy have all modern conveniences. Those of
the poorer classes are nearly comfortless. They are mostly low and
built of adobes, with a roof of tiles, and are arranged in regular
streets crossing each other at right angles. The public buildings are
spacious and ornamental.

Among the principal buildings in San José are the New National
Theatre, in which about 1,000,000 pesos were invested; the National
Palace; the Palace of Justice; the Executive Mansion; the Episcopal
Palace; the National Distillery; the Market; the University; the High
School for Young Ladies; the High School for Young Men; the Custom
House; the Mint, etc.

The city possesses charitable institutions, such as hospitals,
orphan asylums, insane asylums, etc., all under the management
of corporations and associations constantly laboring for their
improvement. The cemeteries are under the supervision of charitable
associations. There are several parks, a Museum, a Public Library
and scientific, legal, medical, literary and musical societies, an
International Club and a German Club, etc.

The streets are mostly macadamized or paved with stones and lighted
by electricity. Nearly every city is well-supplied with water
conducted through pipes.

The food of the poor comprises meat, beans, corn, rice, tortillas and
plantains.

Saturday is the especial market day of the cities, and from sunrise
till noon the market-places are crowded with sellers and buyers.
Here can be found all kind of vegetables and fruits, potatoes, corn,
beans, coffee, tobacco, sugar, cheese, meat and other food, besides
earthenware, hammocks, hats, rebozos, charcoal, etc.

The population of Costa Rica in 1897 was calculated to be 288,769, as
follows:

  90,940 inhabitants in the Province of San José.
  67,972      ”         ”       ”       Alajuela.
  45,161      ”         ”       ”       Cartago.
  37,603      ”         ”       ”       Heredia.
  23,769      ”         ”       ”       Guanacaste.
   8,925      ”         ”    Comarca de Limon.
  14,399      ”         ”       ”       Puntarenas.

The last census, that of 1892, gave 243,205 as the entire population
of the Republic.

The criminal statistics of Costa Rica for 1896 were as follows:

There were 4022 delinquencies punished by the police courts, namely:
1,295 in San José, 626 in Alajuela, 678 in Cartago, 520 in Heredia,
200 in Liberia, 424 in Puntarenas and 279 in Port Limon. Of these
there were convictions of

  1686 for drunkenness and disorder.
   861 for slight misdemeanors.
   340 for fighting, domestic scandals and inflicting slight injuries.
   274 for violations of sanitary and moral ordinances.
   280 for vagrancy.
    80 for carrying arms.
    65 for petty larceny.
     6 for larceny.

There were also 989 criminal sentences recorded in the Court of
Second Instance, together with 124 criminal and civil judgments in
the Court of Cassation.

The national “Presidio de San Lucas” contained at the same time 170
prisoners. Costa Rica in 1896 had 1744 prostitutes, mostly between
sixteen and twenty-five years of age, under supervision. Nearly
half of this number were in San José, the rest in the ports and in
Heredia, Alajuela and Cartago. Nearly 300 women were in the hospitals
being treated for venereal diseases, while 502 individuals were
registered in the “Department de profilaxis venerea.”

There were during the same year thirteen commercial insolvencies, two
cases of absolute and three of partial divorce.

The different courts of the country, during the year of 1896, entered
5417 civil and testamentary judgments, including a number concerning
mining and national land claims.

The people of Costa Rica must be considered as standing high
above those of the neighboring countries in regard to morals and
civilization. The mass of the people is industrious, honest, sober,
clean, comparatively well-clothed, economical, obedient to the
authorities and respectful of the laws.




VII.

IMMIGRATION AND COLONIES.


Immigration to Costa Rica has been small. During the first half of
1897 there entered 1533 individuals by Port Limon and 389 by the Port
of Puntarenas; but during the same time 1150 persons left Costa Rica
through Port Limon and 344 through Puntarenas. The result is a gain
of only 428 persons in favor of the country. In 1896, the excess of
registered immigrants over emigrants was 1112 persons, there having
entered 3980 and departed 2868 persons. Several times attempts have
unsuccessfully been made by foreigners to establish colonies.

Still there is a colony in the Department of Guanacaste, called
“Colonia de Nicoya,” which was commenced by Cubans, headed by Maceo,
the late Cuban revolutionist chief. This colony possesses a sugar
factory and five trapiches, producing 720 quintals of sugar and about
3000 quintals of mascabado. Only five colonists still cultivate
tobacco. The colony has a school for boys and another for girls, the
latter attended by thirty and the other by forty pupils. Besides
there is here postal service and a telegraph office.

A second colony located in the San Carlos district is known as
“Colonia de Aguas Zarcas,” and has 500 lots, but it does not progress
for lack of roads and markets easy to reach.

A third colony was established in Santa Clara, on a branch of the
Atlantic Railroad. But there are actually there only eight families
with about seventy hectares of cultivated land, one trapiche and a
saw-mill.

Another colony was started by the River Plate Trust, Loan and Agency
Company, Limited, in Turialba, near the railroad between Limon and
San José. There were 500 acres sold for 15 pesos each, 2071.9 acres
for 20 pesos each, 750 acres for 25 pesos each, and 1381.1 acres for
30 pesos each, the land being situated on the Tuis River and Cabeza
de Buey. Besides a contract was made with W. C. Beal from Portland,
Oregon, U. S. A., for the sale of 14,000 acres on condition of
procuring each year for seven years the settlement of a number of
families to cultivate these lands. In order to give easy access to
the markets, a cart-road is in process of construction, which will
connect the colony with the nearest railroad station.

The Government of Costa Rica is now preparing new laws in regard to
immigration, colonization and sale of national lands. The former laws
have been suspended, the Government being convinced that the lands
appropriated in former years are more than sufficient to respond to
the requirements of the next twenty years. The Government also thinks
it to be preferable to promote by restrictive laws the subdivision
of these lands and their cultivation than to consent to new grants
under the former statutes. Exceptions are to be made for colonization
companies and enterprises adapted to the economic development of the
country.

In former years the Government of Costa Rica has often offered
inducements in the way of land-grants for European immigration. In
1849 a grant of land of twenty leagues in length by twelve in breadth
was made to a French company for 1000 colonists. The conditions of
the contract were not carried out, though a considerable number of
immigrants formed under it an establishment. A similar grant was made
on the Atlantic coast to a British company, which had no result.

Still another concession was made, May 7, 1852, to a German company
organized at Berlin with Baron von Bülow as Director. This enterprise
died with its manager in 1856.

A further attempt was made in 1852, by Crisanto Medina, to whom
a large grant of land was made for colonization purposes at
Miravalles, about 2500 feet above the sea, but this project too was
abandoned after settling about thirty-seven Germans on the grant. In
1856, some French immigrants came, and in 1858 another colonization
law was passed, and ever since the Government has persisted in the
policy of augmenting the population by offering inducements to
foreigners to settle in Costa Rica. All these Government proffers
have, however, proved ineffectual.

PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.


Elementary instruction of both sexes is compulsory and at the expense
of the Government.

The following data are obtained from the Minister of Public
Instruction, Licentiate Ricardo Pacheco. In 1896 Costa Rica had 327
primary schools with 21,913 enrolled pupils, or 53 per cent. of all
the children of school age, as can be seen in the following table:

  -----------+-------+--------+---------+----------

This great number shows a marked predisposition of the people in
favor of education. It is also a fact that Costa Rica holds the first
place of all Latin American nations in regard to public instruction.

The number of school buildings is 215, besides 29 in process of
construction and 50 projected. These 215 buildings are the property
of the “Juntas de Educacion.” Besides these, 107 buildings are rented
and 6 loaned. There are

   92 schools in  48 different localities in the Department of San José.

Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers. The number of the former
reaches the figure of 784, of whom 337 are men and 447 women,
distributed in the following way:

Among the foreign teachers are:

  38 Spaniards,
  12 Colombians,
   9 Nicaraguans,
   2 Guatemalans,
   2 Salvadorans,
   2 Germans,
   1 Honduran,
   1 Mexican,
   1 Venezuelan,
   1 Frenchman,
   1 Englishman,
   1 Italian.

The average monthly salary is 45 pesos.

There are over 250 “Juntas de Educacion” in the different
Departments, Cantones and Districts.

The National Government aided them with 95,587.59 pesos, in the
following manner:

  16,572.99 pesos to the Juntas of the Department of San José.
  14,686.10      ”         ”      ”        ”         Alajuela.
   2,100.00      ”         ”      ”        ”         Cartago.
  31,768.50      ”         ”      ”        ”         Heredia.
  30,100.00      ”         ”      ”        ”         Guanacaste.
     360.00      ”         ”      ”        ”         Puntarenas.

To aid these Juntas a special school-loan has been made; besides the
taxes on slaughtering are turned over to them.

Higher education is given in the Liceo de Costa Rica, with 206
enrolled students, and in the Colegio Superior de Señoritas, with
223 students, both in San José; also in the provincial Institutes of
Cartago, Alajuela and Heredia.

There is in addition a school for medicine and pharmacy in San José
with seventeen students, and a law-school dependent on the “college
of lawyers.”

For other higher studies the Government pays the expenses of ten
Costa Ricans in European universities and high schools. Further, the
Government of Chile allows six Costa Ricans to study at its expense
in the pedagogical Institute of Santiago.

Another very important national institution is the “Instituto
fisico-geográfico,” under the direction of the very competent
Professor H. Pittier, with three sections; a geographical section for
topographical study and a construction of maps, also a meteorological
and a botanical section. Their excellent publications have proved the
great usefulness of this institution, and it is to be wished that
its able and learned director will get adequate aid to carry out his
promising studies of the physical features of Costa Rica.

Another useful institution is the “National Museum,” under the
intelligent direction of a young Costa Rican scientist. Mr. Anastasio
Alfaro. It has an interesting section of archæology and ethnography,
and a section of zoology, already rich in cabinets, to which is
attached a small zoological garden.

A third useful institution is the “National Library” with 10,242
catalogued books and about 5,000 more ready to be registered and
incorporated.

The first steps towards the organization of educational institutions
were taken in 1824, under the administration of Don Juan Mora
Fernandez. Then public instruction was declared an obligatory duty
of the State. The institution, which afterward became the University
of Santo Tomas, was founded in 1844, at the instigation of Dr.
Castilo. The efforts of Costa Rica to advance education have been
great and sustained, and it is to be remarked that those in office
have constantly shown laudable interest in the matter. In 1869 the
Normal School was opened and a system adopted in harmony with modern
standards.

As related to the subject of public education, the following list
enumerates the names of the principal daily and weekly papers,
periodicals and annual publications:

TRANSPORTATION, POST AND TELEGRAPH.


_Port Limon_ on the Atlantic and _Puntarenas_ on the Pacific Ocean
are first in importance among the means of communication of Costa
Rica.

In 1894 there entered the Port of Limon 294 vessels (271 steamers, 20
barks and 3 goletas), with a tonnage of 348,355 tons. Of these, 16
vessels bore the national flag, 142 the English, 12 the French, 26
the German, 27 the Swedish-Norwegian, 47 that of the United States,
11 the Nicaraguan, and 3 the Colombian flag.

During the same year there entered the Port of Puntarenas 158 vessels
(125 steamers, 24 barks, 5 paileboats 4 launches), having a tonnage
of 155,869 tons. Of these, 14 carried the national flag, 34 the
English, 1 the Italian, 23 the German, 3 the Swedish-Norwegian, 4 the
Danish, 74 that of the United States, and 5 the Colombian flag.

In 1895 there entered the Port of Limon 311 vessels, with a tonnage
of 281,361, while in the Port of Puntarenas there entered 147
vessels, with a tonnage of 146,313.

In 1896 there entered the Port of Limon 258 steamers and 41 sailing
vessels, while 152 vessels entered Puntarenas, of which 73 were
steamers of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, 28 steamers of an
English cattle transporting company, 8 German steamers of the Cosmos
and Kirsten lines, 9 Colombian paileboats, 16 German barks, 11
Norwegian barks, 3 English barks, 2 Italian barks, and 1 French bark.

The agents of the different steamship lines in the capital, San José,
are, for the Port of _Limon_: Mr. Juan Knöhr for the Hamburg American
Steamship Company; Mr. John M. Keith for the Atlas Line; Mr. I. R.
Sasso for the Italian Line, La Veloce; Messrs. Lyon & Co. for the
Royal Mail Line; Messrs. W. J. Field & Co. for the Prince Line; Mr.
Minor C. Keith for the Spanish Transatlantic Line; Messrs. Alvarado
& Co. for the French Transatlantic Line; Mr. Minor C. Keith for the
New Orleans lines; while Messrs. Rohrmoser & Co. are the agents for
the Port of Puntarenas of the Hamburg Pacific Steamship Company, the
Kosmos Line and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.

There are two important railroads, the Atlantic and the Pacific
Railroads. The Atlantic Railroad goes from the Port of Limon westerly
to Alajuela, a distance of 190 kilometers. The stations on the line
are Limon, Moin, S. Mouth, Matina, Siquirres, La Junta, Pascua,
Torito, Turialba, Las Pavas, Tucurique, Juan Viñas, Santiago,
Paraiso, Cartago, Tres Rios, Curridabat, San Pedro, San José, San
Juan, Santo Domingo, Heredia, San Joaquin, Rio Segundo, Alajuela.

A branch of this road starts from La Junta, a point about thirty-four
kilometers west of Port Limon, and runs first northward and then
westward until it reaches Guapiles, a recently founded colony on the
plains of Santa Clara. It was originally intended to lay the track to
Carrillo and through the La Palma Pass to San José, but this plan has
not been carried out.

Another branch goes from Port Limon to the Banana River, a distance
of about five kilometers.

The gross earnings of this road were:

  In 1891-1892              1,409,598 pesos.
   ” 1892-1893              1,973,936   ”
   ” 1893-1894              2,250,979   ”
   ” 1894-1895              2,446,701   ”
   ” Second half of 1895      892,932   ”
   ” 1896                   2,618,113   ”

The net earnings were as follows:

  In 1891-1892                   362,066 pesos.
   ” 1892-1893                   697,479   ”
   ” 1893-1894                   674,452   ”
   ” 1894-1895                 1,030,160   ”
   ” Second half of 1895         677,986   ”
   ” 1896                      1,114,290   ”

It moved during the fiscal year of 1896:

  574,723       passengers.
   10,315       tons of goods for export.
   23,245          ”    imported goods.
   34,558          ”    local freight.
   52,335       tons or 1,570,060 bunches of bananas.
    3,801       animals.

This road has a number of good station-buildings, and a pier at
Port Limon with all facilities for the quick handling of freight,
especially of bananas. The freight rates are relatively very high.

The Pacific Railroad, about fourteen miles (or twenty-two kilometers)
in length, belongs to the Government, and runs from Puntarenas east
to Esparta, about seven hundred feet above the sea. It received
in 1896, 18,486.60 pesos from freights and 19,392.80 pesos from
passengers.

During the same time the Government expended 24,288.31 pesos in
improvements.

Another railroad, on Government account, is under construction to
connect San José with the Pacific coast, and a million pesos are
annually set aside for the work. It is to be about ninety kilometers
long and to run most of the way through the valley of the Rio Grande.
The western end for about twenty-four kilometers will cross a roughly
broken country in order to reach the roadstead of Tívives.

An important line of railway is projected to run from Jimenez, on the
Guapiles branch of the Costa Rica Railway, fifty-six miles from Port
Limon, to the mouth of the Rio Frio, near its entrance into the Lake
of Nicaragua.

It is to cross the River San Carlos near El Muelle, from which
point it is proposed to extend the line through a low pass of the
Miravalles mountains, about two thousand feet above sea-level,
to Culebra Bay on the Pacific. Such a railway would contribute
enormously to the development of northern Costa Rica. The region
traversed by the line is highly fertile. A connection of the Costa
Rica Railway with Lake Nicaragua would also give to the State of
Nicaragua a much needed convenient access to the Atlantic Ocean for
nearly its entire trade.

Another important project President Iglesias contemplates. It is a
ship-canal along the coast line from Matina to the Colorado River,
and even on to the mouth of the San Juan, a total distance of over
sixty-five miles. This coast consists of a continuous narrow sand
bank between which and the mainland there is an inlet or arm of the
sea, said to be navigable now for the whole distance.

This ship-canal would open an extensive banana region as well as
excellent lands for the cultivation of cacao and rubber trees and
many other tropical plants.

With respect to other internal communications, there exists a fairly
good cart-road, opened about sixty years ago, from Cartago _via_
San José to Puntarenas. Over this road nearly all export and import
traffic was done until the Atlantic Railroad was opened in 1891.

Another cart-road runs across Guanacaste to Nicaragua. Besides these
roads there is a small number of shorter and more local roads, not
counting a well-paved one, about twenty-five miles long, now partly
abandoned. It goes through the La Palma Pass towards Carrillo, Santa
Clara and the Atlantic coast.

There is a tramway in Cartago, connecting the city with its
suburbs and Aguacaliente. In San José a trolley line is soon to be
established. Away from the conveniences now enumerated the people
are wont to ride on horse or mule trails. The Government, however,
takes care to increase and improve the cart-roads and other means
of communications. During the last fiscal year over one hundred and
ninety-four thousand pesos were spent on roads and bridges, and there
is no doubt that Costa Rica, in this respect, too, is far ahead
of the other Central American countries. Most of the Government
expenditure named was spent on the national cart-road, the roads to
San Carlos, Puriscal, Tablazo and Sarapiqui and on bridges over the
Rio Grande, Reventazon, Bagaces, etc. In each district there is a
“_Junta Itineraria_” for the conservation and improvement of roads,
every proprietor participating in proportion to his property.

The following itinerary of roads and water routes, their distances
and character, is reproduced from Mr. Richard Villafranca’s “Costa
Rica:”

The _postal service_ is performed by seventy local post-offices.
Correspondence is dispatched twenty-six times per month to foreign
countries by steamers, and four times per month overland to the
neighboring countries. From the port of Limon the mail goes to
Europe, _via_ Hamburg, twice a month, the 12th and 29th; by the Royal
Mail on the 9th day of each month; and _via_ Marseilles on the 12th
of each month; to Europe and the United States _via_ New York every
Friday, and to Europe, the United States and Mexico _via_ New Orleans
every Monday.

From the Port of Puntarenas the mail goes to the West Indies and
South America, _via_ Panamá, three times a month, and as often also
to the States of Central America. Overland to Nicaragua the mail is
sent, _via_ Liberia, every Thursday. In the Gulf of Nicoya are three
steamers in the postal service, namely the “Puntarenas,” “Fernandez”
and “Dr. Castro.” The principal post-offices in Costa Rica are these:

AGRICULTURE AND LIVE STOCK.


Agricultural enterprise in Costa Rica is chiefly devoted to coffee.
The proper coffee zone lies between 800 to 1400 meters of elevation
on both ocean slopes. Experiments have proved that the coffee-tree
can also be successfully cultivated at a height of 600 meters, and
still lower down, by moderating the glare of the sun with adequate
shades and by pruning to correct excessive growth and fructification.

“Coffee was introduced into the country from Havana in 1796 by
Francisco Javier Navarro, as were also the mango and the cinnamon.
The first seeds were sown in Cartago. Much credit for the propagation
of coffee culture in Costa Rica is due to Padre Velarde, under
the government of Don Tomas de Acosta, who took great interest in
agriculture.

“During the administration of Don Juan Rafael Mora (1849-1857)
farming received a remarkable development, for it was much promoted
by the construction of important roads. The cultivation of coffee
and sugar cane then absorbed the attention of the country to such an
extent that, in 1861, 100,000 quintals were exported.” (J. B. Calvo’s
book on Costa Rica).

The census of 1892 supplies the following figures concerning coffee:

Altogether Costa Rica, in 1892, had 8366 coffee-fincas with
26,911,078 coffee-trees, and a crop of 378,224 quintals or 17,388,704
kilograms, valued at 10,954,744 pesos.

It may be interesting to learn the amount of the coffee crops since
1883, given in sacks of fifty-nine or sixty kilograms each.

Another important agricultural product of Costa Rica is the banana.
Its cultivation was begun on the Atlantic coast in 1879, and the
first 360 bunches were shipped, February 7. 1880, by steamer
“Earnholm” from Port Limon to New York.

In 1884 there were 350 farms, comprising over four thousand acres of
land, containing 570,000 banana plants, from which, in that year,
420,000 bunches were obtained. Before 1879 banana plants were set
out in coffee plantations to shade the young trees and shelter their
berries. The bananas were used to feed pigs. The laboring classes
kept a few plants, using the fruit boiled with salt, or roasted on
hot coals instead of bread.

The following table shows the banana export figures since 1883:

            Bundles.    Tons.

Sugar cane is used largely in Costa Rica as fodder and in the
manufacture of aguardiente; also to produce the raw sugar or dulce,
which is consumed entirely by country people.

In 1889 sugar cane by provinces was raised on the following number of
acres:

In San José on 4819 acres; in Alajuela on 5076 acres; in Cartago on
1466 acres; in Heredia on 1114 acres; in Guanacaste on 719 acres;
in Puntarenas on 1471, and in Limon on 122 acres. The aggregates
were 14,787 acres, and a production of 1,368,000 pounds of sugar and
18,454,000 pounds of dulce.

Cacao culture has received but little attention in Costa Rica,
because the more profitable coffee plantations absorb all the time
and capital. The number of plantations regularly established up to
1888 was 198, having in all 56,426 trees that yielded in the same
year 331,900 pounds valued at 165,770 pesos. Most of the cacao was
cultivated in Aserri, Atenas, Naranjo, Heredia, Paraiso, Guanacaste
and Limon.

Cacao was exported from 1884 to 1889 as follows:

  Years.    Pounds.  Value in Dollars.

  1884       9,927        3,227
  1885      16,271        4,084

    Total   90,120       30,204

Excellent cacao was grown during Spanish colonial days around Matina,
but none is exported now.

With respect to wheat, up to 1860 there was sufficient for the
consumption of the country. It was so intelligently cultivated that
the finer grades were produced. The rise in the price of coffee and
the competition with the flour of the United States and Chile drove
out the native wheat almost entirely, and to-day the cultivation of
this grain is badly neglected. To-day the only flour-mill in this
country grinds imported wheat.

Tobacco was a monopoly for many years, and only recently has the
culture been taken up by the people.

Other important agricultural products are rice, beans, corn and
potatoes.

The cultivation of rice in Costa Rica demands very little care and no
irrigation to produce two crops a year of a very superior quality.
Beans and corn are successfully grown everywhere in the country,
while the raising of potatoes is almost wholly confined to the
hillsides of Cartago and Alajuela, where they acquire an extremely
fine quality.

According to the census of 1892, the average annual production of
these crops for that and the two preceding years was in liters as
follows:

Important agricultural districts are, besides the Central Highlands
about one hundred and fifty kilometers in length by sixty kilometers
in width, the great valleys of Talamanca, Santa Clara, Tortuguero,
San Carlos and Rio Frio. Along the Pacific the great valley of
Térraba and the plains of Golfo Dulce and Guanacaste are fertile
regions, which, if properly tilled, would offer advantages equal to
the Central Highlands, where nearly the entire population of Costa
Rica is concentrated.

Plants characterizing fertile lands, rich in humus, on the Atlantic
slope, are _Piper_, especially that with large leaves, _Loaseæ_,
and certain _Acanthaceæ_. On the Pacific side such characteristic
plants are _Piper_, with smaller leaves, the Pacaya Palm, and some
ferns. Especially are the _Aspidium_ and _Polypodium_ found in large
quantities.

Considering the future of Costa Rica, the question of farm labor
is of vital importance. There are only a few Indians, and they are
rapidly decreasing. It looks as though the fertile lowlands on the
Atlantic and Pacific sides, as well as those in the extensive and
fruitful San Juan valley, must be turned over to the Negro race as
the only one capable of enduring so inhospitable a climate. These
regions are the richest of all and could sustain a large population.

The _live stock_ of Costa Rica, though in general superior to that
of the rest of Central America, is not yet sufficiently large to
supply the local demand. Although there has been recent improvement
in breeding cattle and horses, yet the high grade animals, which
could be easily introduced into a country of so many natural
advantages, are still lacking. At different times the development
of this industry has been attempted. Costa Rica has vast pasture
lands splendidly adapted to cattle. It has very nutritious forage
plants, like arrocillo, cola de venado, zacate de guinea, zacate de
castilla, zacate pará, zacate ancho, grama, guate, caña de azucar,
gamalote, sabanilla, teosinte, lengua de vaca, guácimo, jengibrillo,
platanillo, etc.

The _live stock_ of Costa Rica in 1892 was distributed as follows:

                   Cattle.      Horses.      Sheep.     Swine.

Further official reports disclose that in the capital the consumption
of meat is quite uniform during the entire year, while in the country
it is greater from August to January than from February to July.

The total value of the natural, agricultural and live stock products
of the country has been calculated at 19,000,000 pesos.




XI.

COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY.


Joaquin Bernardo Calvo, in his work on Costa Rica published in 1890,
observes that “at the beginning of the Colonial Government the Port
of Suerre, on the Atlantic coast, had some commercial importance, but
that the Port of Rivera on the west coast of the Gulf of Nicoya was
greater, as were also Coronado del Norte on the Island of Caño and
the Golfo de Ossa, now Golfo Dulce.

“All the ships then plying on the Pacific between Mexico, Panama,
Perú and intermediate ports were wont to ride at anchor at the Island
of Caño. The most important centre of commerce in those times was
the City of Santiago de Talamanca, now extinct, whence cargoes were
sent in three days’ time to Porto Bello. The exports of that age were
cacao, potatoes, honey, wax, sarsaparilla and hemp. When the city was
destroyed its traffic was dispersed.

“In 1638 the opening of the Matina road was the beginning of a new
era. The cacao haciendas in the valley of that name acquired a new
importance. At the same time the Gulf of Nicoya became a centre of
traffic. Costa Rica was then in a flourishing condition and would
have prospered finely but for the pirates and Mosquito Indians, who
constantly menaced its welfare and whose vandalism ravaged the coast
settlements.

“After that period Costa Rica was reduced to woeful misery, carrying
on an insignificant commerce overland with Panama by mules and
sending a few unimportant articles to Nicaragua. Thus more than a
century passed.

“In the present century (1813) the Captaincy General imposed severe
restrictions on the commerce of the Province. At the time of
declaring independence the situation of Costa Rica was wretched.

“Just beginning an independent career, struggling to inaugurate a
system of government wholly new and opposed to the preceding one,
contending with poverty, in a state of complete upheaval, the work
undertaken by the forefathers of the present Costa Ricans was full of
difficulties.

“Coffee culture gave a new impulse and importance to Costa Rica. At
the close of the first half of the Nineteenth Century commerce was
carried on with the north through Matina and Sarapiqui, and through
Caldera on the Pacific.

“The greater facilities available on the Pacific coast, however,
especially when a line of steamers connecting with the Panama
Railroad opened a new way to the Atlantic, turned the course of
business to Puntarenas, a new port which soon became the sole
commercial route.

“This state of things, unnecessarily adding to the expense of
importations, continued for years. When the Port of Limon was opened
to commerce the competition of two routes and the new facilities of
a railroad and a wagon road to the Atlantic greatly promoted traffic
and contributed to the general wealth.”

In 1848 seventy vessels entered Puntarenas, having a registration of
7180 tons. In 1884 this number had increased to 113, having 137,368
tons registration, and in the same year there entered Port Limon
121 vessels of 126,875 aggregate tonnage. In 1894 there entered
158 vessels with 155,869 tons at Puntarenas, and 294 vessels with
348,355 tons at Port Limon. The freight in 1858 on coffee to Panama
by steamer alone was five-eighths of a cent per pound. In 1870 the
West India and Pacific Company’s steamers received as freights from
Puntarenas to Liverpool, £5 10s. 0d. per ton; from Puntarenas to
London, £6 2s. 6d. per ton.

In 1888 freights from Puntarenas to European ports were £4 per ton,
and from Port Limon £2. To-day the freight rates are cheaper still.

The present tariff is in many ways inequitable. It is based on no
principle, and, with the exception of some later laws especially
enacted, it does not correspond with the economic condition and
commerce of the country. Yet on a great number of articles the tariff
is less than in Mexico, Guatemala, Salvador, Peru, Bolivia and
Uruguay.

The custom-duties are collected on gross weight, and generally amount
to from twenty to twenty-five per cent. on the valuation of imports.
They are paid one-half down and one-half within three months’ time.
All goods for Costa Rica have to come accompanied by corresponding
consular invoices. The principal importations are silk, wool, linen,
cotton, machinery, implements and tools for agriculture and other
industries, furniture, glassware, tinware, hardware and haberdashery,
ornaments, articles of luxury, mercury and perfumery, beer, wines,
liquors, soap, coffee-sacks, flour, sugar, shoes, saddles, harnesses,
butter, etc.

industry, while at the same time the abundance and relative cheapness
of imported articles rendered useless all attempts at home production.

The _foreign debt_ contracted in 1871 and 1872, in England, against
the will of the nation, has been disastrous to it. It amounts to
£2,000,000 in five per cent. debentures. Lately an arrangement was
made under which the amortization of this debt will begin in 1917,
instead of 1898, and with £10,000 per year, instead of £20,000. The
government is also authorized to buy in its own bonds for their
immediate liquidation.

The _floating debt_ chiefly consists of private deposits, of the
school-loan, amortization of which is made annually, of paper money
which is received in very limited amounts, and of bills payable,
mostly given for sugar and syrups to the “National Liquor Distillery”
and drawn on thirty days’ sight. The rest of the floating debt
scarcely amounts to 50,000 pesos.

In figures the _interior debt_ of Costa Rica may be represented as
follows: 79,155.75 pesos in notes of war emission; 1,037,628.43 pesos
for various accounts, private deposits, cash orders, municipal fund,
ecclesiastical fund, etc., making a total of 1,116,784.18 pesos.

Another important factor in the commercial and economic life of Costa
Rica is the money in circulation. Including every kind of emission,
notes of the Costa Rica bank, national paper money, war-emission
paper money, silver and gold coin, the money in circulation amounted
in

              Pesos.
  1882-83   4,395,089
  1883-84   4,129,518

  1893-94   5,507,343
  1894-95   5,666,207
  1895-96   5,721,837

There were in circulation, in 1895-96, currency valued in pesos as
follows: 3,820,404 of Costa Rica bank notes, 2764 national paper
money, 98,669 war-emission paper money, 1,500,000 coined silver
money, 300,000 coined gold money, total 5,721,837; or 20.08 pesos per
capita of the population of Costa Rica.

As above indicated, the Government of Costa Rica is beginning to
displace the notes of the Banco de Costa Rica by others issued by the
government, maintained at par and guaranteed by a gold reserve or by
gold certificates.

This monetary question is of such interest and importance, that the
following translation is given from such parts of the reports of the
Minister of Finance as relate thereto.

“The emission of gold certificates is necessary, as it would be
impossible to keep the gold coins in circulation so long as the
quantity of paper money issued by the bank, is far greater. Again, in
order to avoid the difficulties which would arise from the constant
retirement of this paper money, the gold certificates must be issued
to furnish an adequate supply of currency. In this way also the
Government has the advantage of utilizing the quantities of gold in
deposit, and of acquiring by means of those certificates resources
for fresh coinage of gold pieces.”

“In order to avoid embarrassment in the commercial and economic life
of the country it has been agreed with the Banco de Costa Rica to
maintain parity between these certificates and its notes. By the
monetary law of October 24, 1896, also parity with the actual silver
peso was established. It was further agreed that the ‘colon de oro,’
the new gold coin, should correspond in intrinsic value with this
standard of ratios.”

“For these purposes, there had to be taken into consideration: First,
the actual state of the national wealth, estimated in the already
established credit circulating medium; second, the average range
of international exchange during a number of years, and third, the
average ratio of silver to gold during the same period. There had
further to be considered the outstanding obligations of the interior
and of the exterior debt, as well as pending negotiations as to
exportable products, and the relation of the intrinsic value between
gold and silver.”

“In this way the following conclusion was reached: That the ‘colon
de oro’ should contain 700 milligrams of fine gold, in order not to
complicate the situation created by the circulating notes of the Bank
of Costa Rica, and in order to include an average exchange of 110
per cent. with respect to the pound sterling, and of 115 per cent.
with respect to the American gold, as well as to create a relation
of 1 to 26 between silver and gold. In consequence of this and for
the purpose of giving to the ‘colon de oro’ the same fineness as has
been given to the American gold coin, and as has been adopted by the
Union Latina, it was established that the ‘colon de oro’ should have
778 milligrams of gold of 900-1000 fineness. Its relation to the gold
coins of either nations is as follows:

  1 American gold dollar         Colones 2.1495
  4 shillings sterling, gold         ”   2.0921
  5 francs, gold                     ”   2.0737
  4 marks, gold                      ”   2.0481

“In the contract with the Banco de Costa Rica, it was agreed that
the Government should coin gold periodically. There are already
600,000 ‘colones de oro’ in pieces of 10 colones in Costa Rica, and
the Government ordered furthermore a second emission of 400,000
colones in pieces of 20 colones each, which will soon be issued. It
is further willing to coin half a million more in the near future.
The Costa Rican Bank, on the other hand, is obliged to retire a
corresponding amount of its notes from circulation, and later, as
soon as sufficient gold can be put in circulation, the exchange of
bills is to be made by this bank in gold instead of silver.”

There are sufficient reasons for believing that the Costa Rican
Government will succeed in the realization of this highly important
economic change without difficulty. As the Costa Rican Bank no
longer has the exclusive privilege of issuing paper money, new banks
must be established, with authority to issue circulating notes. As
these banks will have to keep a reserve of national gold coins for
the redemption of their paper money, there will be an abundance of
currency of a fixed value. As the fineness of the ‘colon de oro’
constitutes the best type of international exchange, there will
in the future be slight fluctuations, and this will prove a most
valuable guaranty of the stability of public wealth.

The private property owners are numerous and the orderly habits
of the Costa Ricans are marked. Costa Rica being an essentially
agricultural country, the necessity of a mortgage law was apparent to
maintain and secure the equities of all. Hence an official registry
of titles and mortgages was opened in 1867.

The landed property of the people of Costa Rica is registered in the
“Registro Publico” in the following way:

Since 1865 the mortgage law permits this mode of converting real
estate; upon due official registration its value may be divided into
shares, each represented by a cedula or bond, on which as collateral
security money can be raised at any time with perfect safety.

This law is included in the Codizo Civil of 1887 and since that time
cedulas to following amounts have been issued:

            Pesos.

  1888       12,000
  1889       60,500
  1890       70,200
  1891      170,100

  1894      482,000
  1895      666,000
  1896    1,002,000
  1897    1,381,700

The municipal taxes are not high. The owners of real estate are
required to pay only the taxes devoted to the maintenance of
municipal police, street lighting and the domestic supply of water.

Other municipal taxes comprise license fees for commercial business,
for slaughtering cattle and hogs; for wine houses; taxes for
registering of dogs; taxes on tanneries, breweries, coffee-cleaning
establishments, cemeteries, etc.

Other important factors of the economic life of Costa Rica are
the existing _banking establishments_. The first bank of Central
America was established in 1857, in Costa Rica, by Crisanto Medina.
This institution ceased and, in 1863, was replaced by the Banco
Anglo-Costaricense with an authorized capital of 2,000,000 pesos and
a paid-up capital of 1,200,000. This bank still exists, together with
the Banco de Costa Rica established in 1867 with a paid-up capital of
2,000,000 pesos. It incorporated with itself the former Banco de la
Union established in 1877.

The Bank of Costa Rica has had from the Government the privilege of
issuing paper money to the extent of four times its cash on hand.
The average circulation of these bank notes since 1882 has been as
follows:

               Pesos.

  1882-83       35,000
  1883-84       56,400
  1884-85      168,890
  1885-86      210,170
  1886-87    1,004,010
  1887-88    1,518,290
  1888-89    2,191,930
  1889-90    2,911,479
  1890-91    3,249,914
  1891-92    3,037,167
  1892-93    2,820,892
  1893-94    3,079,067
  1894-95    3,565,041
  1895-96    3,820,404

This issue privilege was withdrawn in 1897 on the introduction of the
‘colon de oro,’ and a special arrangement was made with the bank to
uphold the contemplated change from a silver to a gold standard.

The Banco de Costa Rica, on July 15, 1897, had a reserve fund of
745,000 pesos and a dividend account of 50,000. It has branches in
Heredia, Cartago and Alajuela. The situation of this bank at the same
date was in pesos as follows:

Foreign commercial obligations were settled through these banks on
the following terms: Drafts at three days’ sight on Paris cost one
per cent. less than on London on same time; those at ninety days’
sight on Paris or London cost one per cent. less than at three days’
sight; those at sixty days’ sight, on New York, cost two per cent.
less than on three days’ sight. Submarine cable transfers of money
cost two per cent. more than by three days’ sight drafts with the
cost of telegraphing added.

Until the 24th of March, 1897, the Bank of Costa Rica sold drafts on
New York for five points more than for those on London. Since the
25th of March, 1897, the difference of exchange between those cities
has been eight per cent.

The rates on London, in October and November, 1897, were 127, and
those on New York were 135.

POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.


Costa Rica is a republic, the government of which is representative,
the representatives being classified so that one-half retires every
two years. Since 1825 Costa Rica has had nine constitutions, the last
one having been promulgated in 1871.

The government is administered through three distinct branches;
namely, the legislative, executive and judicial.

Legislative powers are vested in a single house whose members are
chosen, one for every 8000 inhabitants, for a term of four years
by an electoral college. This body is called the “Constitutional
Congress” and assembles every year on May 1 for a sixty days’
session, which may be extended for thirty days more.

The executive power is vested in the President of the Republic who is
elected for four years and has the power of naming or removing his
four cabinet ministers.

Annually, in May, Congress appoints, for a term of one year, three
substitutes called “designados.” During the intervals between
sessions of Congress legislative power is represented by a board of
five commissioners appointed by Congress.

Judicial power is lodged in a Supreme Court and in subordinate
tribunals as constituted by law. The judiciary is changed every four
years.

Suffrage is restricted to popular conventions which choose a limited
number of electors. These meet in a body called the electoral
assembly and proceed to choose the President of the Republic and the
Congressmen.

The Republic is divided into five Provinces and two Comarcas or
Territories. Both are divided into Cantones, and the Cantones are
subdivided into districts.

The Territories are represented in Congress in the same way as the
Provinces.

Each Canton has a municipal organization popularly elected and a
political chief named by the President.

In each of the Provinces or Territories there is a Governor, and a
military commandant also named by the President, and a Judge of First
Instance appointed by the Supreme Court.

Costa Rica, as soon as she became a member of the Central American
Confederation, organized a judiciary of her own consisting of a
superior court, several tribunals of first resort in the provinces,
and the alcaldes of towns who were justices of the peace with
jurisdiction over petty affairs both civil and criminal. The Supreme
Court has since undergone many changes.

The Supreme Court is a Court of Law composed of five justices. Two
Courts of second instance have three magistrates each.

In each of the Provinces and in the Comarca of Puntarenas there are
judges having criminal and civil jurisdiction.

In the chief towns of each Canton the alcaldes act in civil cases of
minor importance, and in criminal cases are judges of petty offenses,
and for graver charges are committing magistrates.

In the districts the justices of the peace and the police are charged
with maintaining the public peace and they act for small misdemeanors
in a summary way.

For fiscal affairs there are an Inspector General of Hacienda, an
alcalde of Hacienda, and a National Judge of Hacienda. There is also
a special judge of mines residing at San Mateo.

Punishments are generally neither cruel nor protracted. They comprise
confinement in a prison or penitentiary, transportation, or a fine.
The penitentiary is on the island of San Lucas.

In 1841 Costa Rica codified its civil and penal jurisprudence,
amending the code materially seventeen years later. This has been
the basis of her legal progress and is in force except as modified
by subsequent statutes. Among the more important amendments are
these: by the Penal Code in effect since 1880 the death penalty is
abolished, as well as humiliating and cruel punishments; 1886 there
was promulgated a new Civil Code, in which are prominent civil
marriages, the right of divorce and the civil equality of woman.

The Code of Commerce in force, founded on Spanish customs, was issued
in 1853. The Fiscal Code of to-day went into effect in 1885.

The Military Code of 1871 was superseded in 1884 by another more in
accordance with modern institutions.

The Jury System in criminal cases has been in force since 1873.

The Municipal Statutes prevailing to-day were issued in 1867; the
General Police Regulations in 1849.

The “Ley Organica” of tribunals was framed in 1845 and modified
slightly in 1852.

In 1865 there was promulgated the law for a creditor’s proceedings;
the mortgage law was passed in 1865.

Higher and professional education was provided for in 1843 by a law
known as the “Statutes of the University of Santo Tomas,” and in 1886
there was enacted a law for common education.

The Registry of property and mortgages was opened in 1867, since
which time various reforms have been introduced into the Mortgage Law.

There are besides many special laws, like the Mining Statutes
decreed in 1830; the Water Law of 1884 now in force; the Consular
Regulations, and others.

By decree of 24th of November, 1863, the decimal system for moneys
now in use was adopted. By decree of 10th of July, 1884, the metric
system was adopted for weights and measures.

All Costa Ricans between eighteen and fifty years of age are obliged
to do military service according to law.

The army is divided into two parts; the first includes, under the
head of active service, all soldiers from eighteen to forty years of
age; the second comprises all the rest under the head of “Reserve.”

There is a third division, known as the National Guard, including all
citizens capable of shouldering arms outside of the foregoing.

HISTORY.


Until 1540 Spain reserved for the Crown that part of the territory of
Veragua lying west of the portion which had been granted to the heirs
of Columbus, but in that year it was erected into a province called
Costa Rica. According to the narrative of Colonel G. E. Church,
within a period of sixty years from the date of its discovery some
ten feeble exploring and colonizing expeditions, mostly from Panama,
were fitted out to occupy Costa Rica, but they all proved disastrous,
the only result being the exasperation of the natives whom the
Spaniards plundered, butchered and treated with signal barbarity.

Between 1560 and 1573 the limits of Costa Rica were defined and
confirmed by Philip II., those on the Atlantic Coast being the same
as to-day, so far as Nicaragua is concerned.

In 1562 Juan Vasquez de Coronado was named Alcalde and Mayor of the
Province of Costa Rica and Veragua. He founded the City of Cartago
which remained the capital until 1823.

Up to 1622 fifteen governors succeeded Vasquez, but disappointed
in their efforts to find gold, to enslave the Indian population,
or to make the country prosperous, they allowed it to lapse into a
barbarism far worse than it was at the time of its discovery.

Barrantes says that in 1622 it had but fifty Spanish families, and
these were in a condition of extreme poverty.

A report, which the King ordered to be made about that time for
purposes of taxation, stated: “In Costa Rica no mines of any metal
are worked; no gold-washings, no indigo cultivation, no sugar-mill
exist. The people cultivate only maize and wheat. There is no money.
The poverty is such that the flour and biscuits which are not
consumed are exchanged for necessary clothing.”

When Gregorio de Sandoval was named Captain-General, in 1634, and
reached his port from the Atlantic Coast, he noted the importance
of having a better port than that then existing at the mouth of
the river Pacuare, and, therefore, in 1639 founded that of Matina,
connecting it by a mule-trail 102 miles long with Cartago.

From 1666 to the end of the century both the Caribbean and the
Pacific coasts were ravaged by piratical expeditions.

In 1718 Diego de la Haya y Fernandez was appointed Captain-General.
The following year he reported to the King on the condition of Costa
Rica, which he pronounced the “poorest and most miserable of all
America. The current money is the cacao seed, there not being a piece
of silver in the entire country. There is not an eatable sold in
street or shop. Every family has to sow and reap what it consumes or
expends during the year. Even the Governor has to do this or perish.
Meanwhile the inhabitants of the province are contentious, chimerical
and turbulent, and among the whole of them there are not forty men of
medium capacity.”

In 1797 the governorship and military command were conferred on Tomas
de Acosta, but after ruling for twelve years he wrote: “There is not
in the entire monarchy a province so indigent as this, for some of
the inhabitants are clothed with the bark of trees, and others, that
they may go to church, hire and borrow from their friends.”

This may be said to have been the condition of the country when the
domination of Spain ended.

The fifty-eight Governors, who, since 1563, had followed the
ill-fated Vasquez de Coronado, had been little more than managers of
a neglected farm, which scarcely yielded sufficient to enable its
laborers to eke out a miserable, half-starved existence. They had
killed off or enslaved the indigenous population. Their poverty had
precluded the opening of roads or the clearing and cultivation of the
lands, while the exactions of Spain and its barbarous political and
fiscal policy had smothered all commercial interests. In fact, Costa
Rica had, during three centuries of Spanish domination, constantly
retrograded, and when the Spaniard retired from it, he left it less
civilized than when he entered it in 1502.

On September 15, 1821, Costa Rica joined Nicaragua in a decree of
independence. On January 10, 1822, she proclaimed her union with the
Iturbide Empire of Mexico under “the plan of Iguala,” but in 1824
she resumed her independence, declared herself a Republic, elected
Juan Mora as President, who remained in office for eight years, and
became one of the United Provinces of Central America. This weak,
unmanageable union underwent a slow disintegration from 1838 to 1839.
It fell in pieces for want of internal communications, like the old
Columbian federation of New Granada, Venezuela and Ecuador.

Among the twenty-four presidents and dictators who have governed
Costa Rica since 1824, several have been men of marked intelligence
and devoted patriotism, and under their administration the country
has slowly emerged from its former depression, until to-day it may be
said to be in a healthy political and commercial condition.

Costa Rica is very much indebted to its first President, Juan Mora.
Other successful Presidents were: Juan Rafael Mora, from 1850 to
1859; General Tomas Guardia, from 1872 to 1876, and again from 1878
to 1882; Bernardo Soto, from 1885 to 1889, and Rafael Iglesias, since
1894.

Since its independence there have been but few stirring events to
agitate the country. The most important of them was the efficacious
aid it gave to Nicaragua in 1857 in crushing the filibuster Walker,
whose object was to add Nicaragua as slave territory to the United
States.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
